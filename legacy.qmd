## Background

Samuel was our much loved and mighty warrior.

In the past number of years Sam dreamed of going to school and becoming
an accountant. He had great intent in mind with this training -- that
funds he would be responsible for could be used for great purpose. He
would be thrilled that funds raised in his memory would be used for
those purposes.

Sam was courageous in adversity.\
  Sam had a strong sense of justice.\
    Sam had a heart of compassion.

Sam had a heart for God/ Jesus,\
  his friends,\
    for the poor and the hurting.

## Purpose

to come. Funds grown from this endowment will be used to support causes

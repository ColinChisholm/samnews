### [Mark 6: 45 - 46](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MRK.6.NIV)

> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.

### Thoughts and questions 

I think this is an amazing reminder.  Of all people in all of history Jesus is the only one who doesn't need to pray -- he is God.  ... Ok he has also limited himself so he is fully human.  He sets an amazing example for us.  He just finished a massive day

1. He and his disciples travelled by boat to get away from the crowds, but the people found them
2. He taught them all day long
3. He fed them -- praying and blessing the food. 
4. He sent his disciples on, and dismissed the crowd.  

I know I would have been beyond exhausted from this.  Jesus, goes up on the side of a mountain and prays.  

### Prayer

Jesus thank you for your example to pray and even when to pray.  May my heart yearn to be with God and spend time in thought and prayer with him at all times, and especially when I am weakest.

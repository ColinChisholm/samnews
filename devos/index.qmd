I have started these posts in response to, and specifically for Sam.  We had a great talk near the end of May 2023 about how the devo book he was reading was not providing anything new, and was trying too hard to be relevant.  Here, I will simply try to read, provide some of my thoughts and provide a prayer.

It is my hope that these posts will provide opportunities for further spiritual discussion and development.  

_These devos are definitely good for me too._

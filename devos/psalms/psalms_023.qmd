It's our 28^th^ anniversary and this has been the hardest year of our
lives. Sam is doing well but still has cancer and it remains unknown
if it can be stopped.

This morning Tina asked me to meditate on [Psalm
23](https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/PSA.23.NRSV). 

My reading is dark.
Today I receive little comfort from this Psalm. The only comfort is in
the recognition of the pain and torment of our current situation.

| Psalm23          | My response         |
+==================+=====================+
| > The Lord is my | *And yet I am left  |
| > shepherd, I    | in want. Am I a     |
| > shall not      | sheep, trapped in   |
| > want.          | the wilderness?     |
|                  | Where is my         |
|                  | shepherd? I cry*    |
|                  | *and it seems He    |
|                  | does not hear.*     |
+------------------+---------------------+
| > He makes me    | *I long for green   |
| > lie down in    | pastures.\          |
| > green          | To be there with my |
| > pastures;\     | family. Yet there   |
| >  he leads me   | death in him. I     |
| > beside still   | cannot leave him.\  |
| > waters;\       | I cannot ignore it. |
| >  he restores   | Fear of death rots  |
| > my soul.       | at my soul.*        |
+------------------+---------------------+
| > He leads me in | *I try to follow    |
| > right paths\   | the right path,\    |
| >  for his       | remembering what    |
| > name's sake.   | the shepherd has    |
|                  | taught me.*         |
|                  |                     |
|                  | *Is all of this for |
|                  | his name's sake?*   |
+------------------+---------------------+
| > Even though I  | *Yes, this is a     |
| > walk through   | dark, dark valley.  |
| > the darkest    | A valley of death.  |
| > valley,\       | Though I fear no    |
| >  I fear no     | eternal evil, I     |
| > evil;\         | fear. Are my fears  |
| >  for you are   | not justified? The  |
| > with me;\      | disease in real and |
| > your rod and   | the Lord remains    |
| > your staff—\   | silent.*            |
| >  they comfort  |                     |
| > me.            | *Tough Your ways    |
|                  | guide me, I         |
|                  | question if they    |
|                  | are any comfort.*   |
+------------------+---------------------+
| > You prepare a  | *My enemies are*    |
| > table before   | Death *and*         |
| > me\            | Despair*. They sit  |
| >  in the        | here at the table   |
| > presence of my | with us. Yet it     |
| > enemies; you   | seems we are the    |

| >  my cup        | Death *and us for*  |
| > overflows.     | Despair*.*          |
|                  |                     |
|                  | *There is no cup,   |
|                  | no meal for me –    |
|                  | rather You are      |
|                  | serving us up.*     |
|                  |                     |
|                  | *When will you      |
|                  | rescue us?*         |
+------------------+---------------------+

|                  | want, but what you  |
|                  | want."              |

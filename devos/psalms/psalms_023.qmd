It's our 28^th^ anniversary and this has been the hardest year of our
lives. Sam is doing well but still has cancer and it remains unknown
if it can be stopped.

This morning Tina asked me to meditate on [Psalm
23](https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/PSA.23.NRSV).

My reading is dark. Today I receive little comfort from this Psalm.
The only comfort is in the recognition of the pain and torment of our
current situation.

| Psalm23         | My response        |
+=================+====================+
| > The Lord is   | *And yet I am left |
| > my shepherd,  | in want. Am I a    |
| > I shall not   | sheep, trapped in  |

|                 | Where is my        |
|                 | shepherd? I cry*   |
|                 | *and it seems He   |
|                 | does not hear.*    |

|                 |                    |
|                 | *Is all of this    |
|                 | for his name's     |

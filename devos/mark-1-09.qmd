### [Mark 1: 14-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MRK.1.NIV)


> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,”he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”


### Thoughts and questions

Why such a short passage today?  I think these two verses are essential as we consider the rest of the gospel.  Jesus starts with proclaiming the good news -- the gospel.  But what is it? 

-   _The time has come_: we need to remember that the people of Israel have been waiting, and a nation they had been waiting for hundreds of years.  Jesus says now is the time.  
-   _The kingdom of God has come near_:  I try to imagine myself hearing or reading the book of Mark for the first time, without all that I have heard at church or through schooling.  At this statement, I am a little confused:
    -   What is the kingdom of God? 
    -   How has it come near?
-   _Repent and believe the good news._  Jesus calls us to respond.  Imagining myself as a first time reader I need to understand more. 

I think we had a hint/ partial answer to these questions in verse 11 (_you are my Son..._), and I expect that the remainder of the book of Mark will provide more detail, answer these questions.

### Prayer

Lord God, please open our eyes and our hearts to hear your good news.  We have been taught it, but refresh and refine it in us.  Please reveal to us how we should respond!

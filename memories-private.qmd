Church in the park. Seeing this group of young men together, Chisholm, Claus & Cross (Zachary Giesbrecht was there too-I just missed him at the other end of the line beside Chase)… shoulder to shoulder, participating in a city-wide church service was absolutely incredible.  Mighty men of God.  I pray they each run their race well.  Sam has crossed the finish line and is now cheering them on.

Caleb had his first “real” job at Dairy Queen this past year.  After every shift he would tell me who he knew that came through or the weirdest blizzard combination. Having Sam walk in with both of you to order was a huge highlight!

So many memories today.  Memories of birthday parties… Chase’s 4th birthday (his first in Prince George) that prompted the first official play date and launched their friendship.  I loved seeing Sam lead Ben & Chase, one after the next into each new “year” of their lives.  The 3 amigos. 

This summer when Caleb had the opportunity to drive Sam & Chase to the movies, it was so special.  Caleb really absorbed the responsibility of being trusted with your son, with Sam, to go for that first independent teenage drive.  I knew Caleb would take good care of Sam.  He really loved Sam like a little brother.

My strongest memory of Sam is the gentleness and warmth that felt like it radiated from him whenever we saw him. He always had a smile for our little Ellie whenever he saw her - and he seemed to radiate a deep care for her that felt so tangible. 

I remember seeing Sam, Colin and Tina later on in our journey. We were so grateful in a monitoring stage. Sam was heading for a test and in the midst of the storm. And he had this warm smile for us - it felt like it said “I’m so happy to see her doing well.” 

I am so deeply grateful for the whole Chisholm families warmth, care and faith. Especially your faith amidst the hardest things imaginable - it was a balm on our hurting hearts. We love your whole family so much.

We really only saw Sam when he was with his parents, in the hospital. But I was always struck by the love and joy and hope I felt from all of them. Their love for each other was so tangible it was like a physical structure in the room. We're so glad we got to meet Sam.

All our love to Tina and Colin.

Didn't know Sam very well and only met him a couple of times BUT the time that really stands out for me was when Tina, Sam and myself sat in Bob's little cabin in the loft and talked.  The three of us must have talked for a few hours and it was then that I realized how special and important Sam was.  His openness and transparentcy was way above what my experience with most young people was.  He shared his loves, his joys, his hopes and dreams and even some of the challenges he was facing at the time.  But most of all Sam shared his faith in God,  a God who he knew in his heart.  A God who was so real to Sam.   He was sooooo open and honest and my heart opened that day in way which surprised me.  As I said, we shared for some time and then he and his family finished loading up the fifth wheel and headed home.  It was a very special moment and I am so very grateful that I got to spend those hours getting to know such a fine and influence young man.  Thankyou.

I loved watching Sam grow, especially that moment when I realized he had gotten taller than his mom! What a sweet moment to see them in the kitchen and realize that he had done it! To see him grow, up close from age 8 to almost 16 was a privilege. I loved Sam’s heart for other kids who were unwell and sweet relationships with his parents and grandparents, as well as his heart for obeying and seeking God.

Our YWAM grade 11 trip was my favorite memory with Sam. It was like for a few days he was in our class again, like he had always been there. We went for ice cream  and him and David made fun of my height. I laughed so much that night.

Dear Sam,

 Thank you for being there for Nova and me when we needed friendship. We bonded with you over hockey games at first and then board games; and it was your conversation, wit and banter that always had us smiling. 

 One of the first interactions we had was when the naughty kids were banging on doors and running away. I stopped them to give them a talking to… when they started talking back, you stood up from the lounge couch and came over to assist. You were direct and to the point about the rules and how they should be followed. I could see how they immediately looked up to you - not just because you are tall, but because you showed strength and conviction about what is right. 
 
 You also helped Nova. She grew in leaps and bounds because, while at RMH, she wasn’t the oldest child. She now had an older brother that showed her strength, courage and hope. Through you, we always felt more courageous and we never lost hope.

And joy. We always had joy seeing you and your family. The best times we had at RMH were spent playing Too Many Bones, Root, family edition of CaH, and of course, Mysterium. So many laughs! Remember the strong connection you had with Bob the ghost aka. Glen? You were the first to finish and we had to get your help to understand our own visions from Bob. 

You will be remembered Sam. 
You will be missed. 

Much love to you and your family, 
Janelle and Nova.

It’s hard to pick one memory of Sam. Our family met Sam (and Tina) when Sam and John had swim lessons together the week before they started kindergarten together. From then on, memories of Sam are woven into memories of my own children growing up. Trips to Bear Lake, playing on the playground at Cedars, Cedars field trips,  going to the park after school, after school snacks, trick or treating,, making gingerbread houses, sleepovers, hikes, camping—so many memories, so many good times. I can’t believe that Sam is gone. We will feel the loss of him deeply.

Sam was our son Rushil's first ever friend after moving to Canada. We still vividly remember that interaction, Sam was quite shy so he made Colin ask our son what his favorite Pokemon was. Ever since then Rushil and Sam have been very close friends, hanging out almost every week.  Rushil even decided to switch schools to be in the same one as Sam. Sam was a delight to be around and he always lit up the room. Sam will always be a part of our hearts and we will always be grateful to have had someone like him in our lives.

Here is a photo of Sam during his April visit to youth group. I loved the way he fit right back in with the kids. The way they picked right up with him and he picked right up with them. I loved seeing his bravery and determination. His joy in the simple things like playing a game of Bohnanza. Watching this warmed my heart and is a precious memory to me of your sweet boy. 

I have a few more pictures from youth group that I would like to send. Would email be a way I can do that?

We moved to PG at the end of May 2024 and we're delighted that our first Sunday here, June 2nd, was a community church service in the park. We "happened" to sit behind a row of fine young men including Sam! It was so nice to see these guys together side by side that morning. ❤️Anne

Sam is between my kids in age so I didn’t interact with him a great deal as I was dropping off or doing Mom Visits in the playground.  But what I do remember is Tina, faithfully at the playground watching Sam play, talking to the moms, every day.  

Tina, I always saw your love for, and pride in, your little boy.  Every time I saw you, every time we talked.  It was obvious that your day was better because Sam was in it.  You gave 100%.

That the Lord was pleased to call Sam home is heart breaking and beyond our ability to understand.  But we rest in the assurance that God is good - all the time - and faithful to us.

This picture was taken on March 3, 2023.  Just shortly before Sam was whisked away to Vancouver.  I remember the youth event and Sam coming to join us at the mall and then came back to our house for more fun.  I remember Tina saying how much Sam wanted to come, even though he wasn't feeling great.  It was so great to have him at this youth event.

The first time me and my family went down to go visit Sam in the hospital was the second weekend in May. This was when Sam was still in the actual Children's Hospital and not yet in the RMH. My brother and Sam played video games on the Saturday that we were down (I think they played one of the LEGO video games), and then, on the Sunday before we drove back, we went to go visit Sam again. This time, we played Coup, which is a board game about lying. Sam was able to walk to the dining room area on the oncology floor, and we got to sit near a window and play Coup together.

Sue and I came to Prince George for Alex's Birthday and Thanksgiving with the family. I thought I'd get a break not cooking the Thanksgiving Turkey 
( that's my thing ) but not the case.
After the turkey was done and sat for a bit I was getting ready to carve the Bird and I noticed Sam eyeing the MASSIVE Turkey leg I just removed. I asked if he'd like the whole leg and he just smiled, so I asked his dad Colin if that was OK, the answer was sure he work would live it so he got the Turkey leg and this is the photo I always look at and cherish. And here's a few other pics that are great.  Use what you want and I hope it makes you smile just a bit. 
Love Fred and Sue 
And we're sending love and prayers to you

My name is Jayden, I met you once at camp. I remember shortly after I moved to Prince George from Abbotsford,  I started going to youth group. This was two or three months before Sam got sick. I accidentally pulled the fire alarm at the Pine Glen apartments. I got teased a lot for that and I remember Sam specifically finding that funny and teasing me about, that was how we became friends. After that I occasionally saw Sam at youth and I really enjoy hanging out with him then. But my favorite memory of Sam was when he came to camp for a week, I enjoyed catching up with and just talking to him about random things. Sam told me about his camp name "raid" because mosquitos would die when they bit him, which I thought was a pretty creative name. The picture is me, Sam, and Julia from camp. Ive found this to be really hard and I'm so sorry for your loss,I pray for you everyday.

When I taught Sam when he was in Grade 4, he was always so kind and respectful to his classmates. He never missed saying a special hello to me everyday . When he saw me at church, he would always wave. 
He was given a gentle spirit by His Lord. Our family is so saddened by his passing but we know for sure he is pain free with his Lord. Our love and prayers to you both, Colin and Tina, Mary and your extended family.
Sincerely,

Sam & Chase.  Chase sharing his thoughts.  Sam pondering & responding.  This was on our trip back to visit in 2019 and the day we went to explore Hixon falls with a bunch of friends.  It was so amazing to see the depth of friendship that they returned to so quickly.  That trip sparked conversations and eventually our decision to move back to Prince George.

Three or four years ago when we were visiting with the Chisolms, the topic of us having to find another rental came up and Sam immediately started brainstorming to help find a solution  - this touched our hearts so deeply as it was obvious how much Sam cared.

Being so young, Sam was not only caring but a solution finder; not very many young people like Sam have the kind of heart that he has.  I say, "has," because where he is in Heaven, he still has that precious caring heart.

I can only imagine how much brighter Heaven is because of Sam Chisolm' s presence there. We have been so very blessed to have gotten to know Sam.....there are no words to describe what he means to us.

My memory of Sam was from the first time I met him at RMH he was so full of life and up beat smiling everytime i saw him and his dad.
He was such a strong kid that fought till the end. A true warrior

I remember Sam coming to the yard to hang with Ayden and his brother Devlin and step sister Annabella. My window was open and I could hear the boys talking and though I can’t remember the exact word Devlin said I heard Sam speak up saying that is a bad word and disrespectful to God. I was so impressed a youth would so easily speak up and wear his faith out in the open. Devlin argued with Sam but Sam stood his ground in such a quiet and respectful manner. 

I have always been so impressed what a kind soul Sam has. Always polite and so willing to help me in times of need with doing the driveway. I was always so struck by his thanks for money and never asking a lot to do the jobs which is so u like the ends of entitlement seen often in society today. 

Sam has and will continue to be an inspiration to me on how to walk though trials with joy of the Lord showing and shining so great. Though he cannot be seen physically I still have a strong sense of Sam’s presence 

I will never stop talk about Sam and continue to share about Sam with Ayden and my kids. We all continue to pray for you both Tina and Colin. You both are such a transparent and honest speciation of the heartache of the journey and loss and also how to grieve as a couple and individuals with the power of God. Gods love surrounding human frailty. 
It is a privilege and honour to have met you all and I pray we continue to connect 

Big big hugs and 💗

Ughh. You guys know Im not so good with the things to say.. FUCK CANCER 
Im so sorry  💔

Being the only teen boys, there was some reluctance to hang out in the beginning, I recall Linkyn saying to me  “what are we supposed to talk about?!! Our cancer?!!” I reassured him Sam probably doesn’t want to talk about it either… but just goo!! Hang out for a bit. Talk about your moms. Hahaha 
RMH photo attached. Wasn’t the first time they locked the littles out so the Den was all theirs. 

We miss him & you guys dearly. Honestly, all of our RMH family. We speak of Sam often & we are here if we can support you. 

Thank you for the updates. 
Big hugs. 
We will see you soon. 💔❤️‍🩹
Love.  🤍✨

Nana is not the best at writing her recipe's down but she did write this one up for me. ... And once I watched her make it one more time I was able to refine the recipe.  In early 2025, I was able to sort out a gluten-free and dairy free option.

dry

-   1 cup flour\
(_GF: 2/3 cup gluten free flour_)
-   1.5 tablespoon white sugar\
(_GF: 2.0 tablespoon white sugar_)
-   1/4 teaspoon salt 

wet 

-   4 large eggs
-   1.25 cup of milk\
(_GF: 2/3 cup oat milk and 2/3 cup water_)
-   1+ teasppon of vanilla\
    (use pancake syrup if you can't find vanilla -- then cut back on sugar)
-   1 tablespoon of oil

notes

-   Sugar, for garnish

-   Fry in a well heated and generously oiled pan

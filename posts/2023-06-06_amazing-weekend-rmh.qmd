-   writing from the RMH, family is sleeping
-   We have had such an amazing weekend together! 

## Reflections on ...

### June 3

-   A day of rest
-   Exploring the RMH
-   Taking care of the medical items ourselves -- medications and needles and NG tube feeding.  We had it all down -- until we didn't.  We do not have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while in the hospital:  The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it back -- after working at it for an hour got as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a trick that sometimes works to dissolve the clog).


### June 4

-   NG remained clogged -- Sam's job: to eat and demonstrate that the NG is not needed -- he did not fail us!  Our boy's appetite is back! 
-   Visit with Uncle Kevin
-   Visit with Chris and Jane -- including Sam's first trip away from hospital properties! We went to White Spot in Kerrisdale -- Sam had a milk-shake and a the double-double (with a little left over).

### June 5

-   



## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful for the upcoming opportunity to get out for a few days.
    Round 3 of chemo will likely start next Tuesday. There will be
    adjustments as we take on a new routine.

-   Thankful for the chance to visit with friends.

-   Thankful for date nights!

-   Thankful to see Sam's blood counts returning to normal including the
    numbers indicating the strengthening of hi immune system.

-   Challenges of side-effects. Sam, although have a return of energy,
    is becoming physically exhausted. This whole regime, and being
    bed-bound for a full week has led to parts of his system being bound
    -- constipation is significant issue. It will pass but likely not
    without pain. GI sores from the chemotherapy also complicate this.

-   Concern, a recent scan flagged a the potential for a problematic
    kidney stone.

-   Upcoming, this Friday June 2, Sam is books for a PET scans. The
    purpose of this scan is to determine to current state of the cancer.
    We look forward to knowing the results. We are excited that previous
    scans suggest significant reductions in the cancer and that this
    scan should confirm that. As always, we will remain concerned about
    any cancer in his system.

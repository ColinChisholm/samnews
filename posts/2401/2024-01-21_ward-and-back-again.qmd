## Looking back

Last post I wrote about the viral illness that Sam had, and the removal
of some steroid supports that he had post BMT. He was making slow
progress recovering from it all.

On Jan. 11 we went in for a clinic appointment with the Endrocine team.
However, they were not fully satisfied with how Sam responded to the
treatments they initiated ... unexplained low blood pressures tend to
send off alarm bells for physicians. So we went up to the oncology
clinic to let our regular medical team evaluate Sam and consider his
situation from their perspective. The team there decided to admit Sam to
the ward. I confirmed later that this was due to a number of small flags
that went off for them â€“ if any one flag was presented they would have
sent us back out. However, whatever was going on with Sam, though
ambiguous, added up to be significant enough to be admitted.

Over the next few days we saw very little improvement but then he
started to come around. There were a lot of question-marks about what
was going on with Sam and when we asked "*What is going on with Sam?"*
the answer was "*We don't know*." Various tests were run and general
treatments were provided.

The nurses called it being in for a '*tune-up*' and they reassured us
that it was very normal for someone, following a BMT, to come back to
the ward for whatever was ailing them. The idea of a *tune-up* is not a
bad analogy though it felt more like a major tune-up -- like Sam was
only running on 1 or 2 cylinders.

Sam started feeling better following about five days of treatment
(fluids, antibiotics, steroids), and by day 8, this past Thursday, he
demonstrated he was strong enough to leave the ward. We are now back at
the RMH.

Ughh. All of those days of illness, including the 10 days prior to being
admitted were hard. It is the not knowing: What is happening? What is
the problem? Will we find a solution? Is this the cancer? To complicate
things, especially for Tina, was the fact that she still had bronchitis,
because of this she was not able to spend much time on the ward with Sam
and I. I am thankful that Nana Mary was able to be with her during this
last time on ward.

## Looking forward

In the weeks ahead we will need to keep a close eye on Sam's energy
levels. We have been given some flexibility in managing steroidal
supports (e.g. in response to illness or injury). So if we see his
energy fading we can pump him up a little. The steroids are intended to
mimic natural bodily levels, as given the previous BMT related
treatments his body is not yet generating natural responses -- this is
all expected (by the doctors). It is also expected that Sam's own
hormone balancing system will restart after a month or two. Again we
wait and hope.

### Hope in the waiting

I can't help but remember that when we were learning Spanish, in our
days working in Guatemala, that verb *esperar* means to wait, and it
also mean to hope (the noun for hope is *la esperanza*). So when we say
we wait -- I also mean we hope. Of course, hope itself is a choice. In
many ways it is a choice to expect the good and to actively reject
living in anxiety. This is more than a psychological trick. Our hope and
trust have true foundations. I have hope because of our incredible
medical team, and ultimately we have hope in God.

### Medical plans

This week will be a return to regular clinic visits. We will also start
a repeat of all of the baseline testing that was done prior to the BMT.
This will involve visits to all of the specialties in the hospital, and
various imaging tests to evaluate if/how this whole BMT journey has
impacted Sam.

We will also continue weaning the various drugs that Sam has been on --
primarily reducing morphine levels.

## Victories and concerns

-   A concern for Tina and I is that it is not always easy to choose
    hope. The reality is that choosing hope is a discipline. Given
    everything that we as parents have gone through, including all of
    the alternate outcomes that we have seen, it is very easy to slip
    into anxious thinking.

-   We are no longer having medical discussions about upcoming
    treatments. Discussions are now about weaning medications, removing
    the central line, completing baseline tests for comparison with the
    pre-BMT testing, and preparations to return home!

-   We very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the
    donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation *I cannot thank
    you enough*.

-   We are thankful to the medical team who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great
    confidence.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   There is always concern if the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease. A PET scan will be done in
    February to evaluate how the cancer has been impacted by all the
    treatments. The expectation is that any remaining cancer, following
    the chemo and radiation therapies, will be removed by the newly
    transplanted immune system.

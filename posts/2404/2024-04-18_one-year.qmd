:::



It has taken me ~~three~~ four days to write this post. Sam has had such
great energy lately. He has been waking up at the same time as me and we
have spent our days together – talking, playing, reading, and even
sharing the chores.

In the early morning just over a year ago, on April 18, 2023, Sam
arrived at BC Children's hospital. Oh, how far he as come along this
incredible journey of seeing him return to health. He is by no means
out-of-the-woods yet, but now he can "walk-in-the-woods" with us. Sam is
joyful, he has increasing energy and stamina, and his courageous attitude
seems to have no limits.

One year ago Tina and Sam had been sent down by air ambulance and were
admitted directly to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). I arrived
about twelve hours later. Sam remained in PICU for the next number of
days while the medical team stabilized him, and initial imaging and
biopsies were completed. It would be 10 days later that 
the biopsy reports were completed and Sam's cancer was identified. Once
identified, we knew we would be travelling a challenging road -- one
that was not mapped by any procedures or protocols that the medical
team could follow.

## Gratitude

We have so much to be grateful for throughout this journey (in no way is
this quick list complete).

-   Sam has received incredible medical care at the BC Childrens'
    Hospital and BC Cancer Centre

    -   The doctors have pooled their collective expertise having to
        make untold numbers of decisions based on their professional
        judgement and not just established protocols.
    -   The nurses on the oncology ward and later in clinic have shown
        Sam (and his parents) incredible care. We will forever treasure
        the compassion and personal connections that we have had all of
        you.
    -   Access to incredible tools used to diagnose and accurately locate
        the disease in Sam, and all of the diligent technicians and
        radiologists.
    -   All of the support staff, seen and unseen, that have made Sam's
        care possible

-   A stranger who provided Sam a new immune system.

-   Incredible charities that have supported us

    -   The Ronald McDonald House has provided us a home away from home.
    -   Canuck Place has advised on Sam's care and provided great
        counsel for Tina and I.
    -   Friends of Children provides assistance to families from northern BC

-   The love of friends and family supporting us. We treasure your
    visits and communications.

-   The hundreds of people praying and caring for Sam -- thank you.

## Celebration despite ambiguity

There is so much unknown.  We know that Sam's cancer remains.  It is unknown 
if the treatments he has ongoing will be wholly effective.

Despite this ambiguity we celebrate! Currently, Sam is doing well. 
The last PET scan on April 5^th^ suggests that Sam's cancer
has been stable! The central mass remains but has not grown and the
immune system has been actively working there. The three disease centres found
earlier have been neutralized.

More than the state of the cancer, we celebrate that Sam is feeling
good! He is gaining strength. He is active and enjoying life!

There is much work to be done but for the time being it seems we are winning -- I pray that
this is true and continues to be true.

## Major Milestones

What a journey this has been. Sam has been through three eras of cancer
treatment: 1) chemotherapy, 2) BMT, and now 3) immune therapy. Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy. Below is provided a quick review of the major milestones.

### Chemotherapy

+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Date         | Description                 |
+==============+=============================+
|              |                             |
| **2023**     |                             |
|              |                             |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| April 17     | An alarming x-ray in        |
|              | Prince George               |
|              | provided evidence that      |
|              | Sam needed urgent           |
|              | care at BCCH.               |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| April 18     | Air Ambulance in the        |
|              | early morning and           |
|              | admission to BCCH's         |
|              | PICU.                       |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| April 22     | Transfer to BCCH            |
|              | Oncology Ward (T8).         |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| April 28     | Diagnosis of a extremely    |
|              | rare form of                |
|              | lymphoma.                   |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| April 29     | Chemotherapy is             |
|              | initiated. Sam will         |
|              | receive an additional 6     |
|              | full rounds of              |
|              | chemotherapy taking him     |
|              | into October.               |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| June 2       | Following his second        |
|              | round of chemotherapy       |
|              | Sam was discharged from     |
|              | the hospital for the        |
|              | first time. This marks      |
|              | the beginning of our        |
|              | family life at RMH. The     |
|              | next months we would        |
|              | visit the oncology          |
|              | clinic regularly. When      |
|              | it was time for each        |
|              | round of chemotherapy we    |
|              | would check into the        |
|              | ward for about 5 days.      |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| July 14      | Plans for a bone marrow     |
|              | transplant were             |
|              | initiated. By               |
|              | mid-summer it became        |
|              | apparent that the           |
|              | chemotherapy would not      |
|              | remove all of the           |
|              | cancer. The remaining       |
|              | rounds of                   |
|              | chemotherapy would          |
|              | reduce the cancer as        |
|              | much as possible, and       |
|              | keep it from                |
|              | spreading to new            |
|              | locations, while the        |
|              | BMT was being organized.    |
|              |                             |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Sept. 26     | Preparations for BMT,       |
|              | baseline testing of Sam     |
|              | was initiated to            |
|              | evaluate impacts of the     |
|              | BMT (i.e. eye, ear,         |
|              | skin, and lung capacity     |
|              | testing).                   |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Oct. 15      | Sam completed his final     |
|              | round of                    |
|              | chemotherapy.               |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Oct. 23      | Targeted radiation          |
|              | therapy over three days     |
|              | to destroy the              |
|              | central mass in Sam's       |
|              | chest is initiated. This    |
|              | was completed at the BC     |
|              | Cancer Centre over 10       |
|              | days.                       |
+--------------+-----------------------------+
| Nov. 8       | Total body radiation is     |
|              | used to completely          |
|              | remove Sam's existing       |
|              | immune system – to kill     |
|              | the blood producing         |
|              | cells in his bone           |
|              | marrow. This was done to    |
|              | make way for the bone       |
|              | marrow                      |
|              | transplant.                 |
+--------------+-----------------------------+




### Bone Marrow Transplant

+--------------+--------------------------+
| Nov. 14      | Bone marrow              |
|              | transplant is            |
|              | received. Sam had        |
|              | been admitted to         |
|              | the oncology ward a      |
|              | few days prior in        |
|              | preparation and          |
|              | would remain on          |
|              | ward in isolation for    |
|              | the next                 |
|              | number of weeks.         |
|              | This was a               |
|              | particularly             |
|              | intense time as the      |
|              | medical team had to      |
|              | provide so many          |
|              | supports to his          |
|              | body                     |
+--------------+--------------------------+
| Nov. 25      | First indications        |
|              | that the BMT was         |
|              | establishing –           |
|              | engraftment.             |
|              | Official                 |
|              | engraftment would        |
|              | be  established          |
|              | on Dec. 1 based on       |
|              |    metrics from          |
|              | Sam's blood.             |
+--------------+--------------------------+
| Dec. 13      | Sam is discharged        |
|              | from the hospital        |
|              | with plans to            |
|              | continue regular         |
|              | check-ins at the         |
|              | oncology clinic.         |
+--------------+--------------------------+
| **2024**     |                          |
+--------------+--------------------------+
| Jan. 11      | Stepping down from       |
|              | all of the various       |
|              | medications              |
|              | had its challenges.      |
|              | Sam was admitted to      |
|              | the ward for eight       |
|              | days to determine        |
|              | what was causing         |
|              | his extreme              |
|              | lethargy. It was a       |
|              | complicated picture      |     
|              | as we all had a flu      |
|              | in the days prior        |
|              | but what Sam was         |
|              | experiencing was         |
|              | more. In the end         |
|              | the main issue           |
|              | seemed to be             |
|              | adrenal insufficiency.   |
+--------------+--------------------------+



### Immune therapy

+---------------+----------------------------+
| Feb. 14       | PET scan, that we were     |
|               | all hoping to be           |
|               | Sam's last before          |
|               | having to go home,         |
|               | revealed a horror – the    |
|               | cancer had spread to       |
|               | three new locations.       |
|               | New battle strategies      |
|               | are brought into play.     |
|               | Plans to return home are   |
|               | canceled.                  |
+---------------+----------------------------+
| Feb. 29       | Sam receives his first     |
|               | dose of Nivomulab used to  |
|               | intentionally              |
|               | de-regulate Sam's          |
|               | immune system and to       |
|               | turn off specific          |
|               | protein markers on the     |
|               | cancer cells that allow    |
|               | them to hide from the      |
|               | immune system.             |
+---------------+----------------------------+
| March 11      | Targeted radiation         |
|               | starts against the three   |
|               | new                        |
|               | sites. The shin and hip    |
|               | sites would see higher     |
|               | doses over four days.      |
|               | The T3-vertebrae would     |
|               | see lower daily            |
|               | radiation doses over       |
|               | ten days.                  |
+---------------+----------------------------+
| April 5       | PET scan demonstrated      |
|               | that: a\) The three new    |
|               | disease sites had been     |
|               | effectively killed         |
|               | using radiation, b\) the   |
|               | central mass was stable    |
|               | c\) However, a new site    |
|               | in Sam's liver raised      |
|               | new alarm bells.           |
+---------------+----------------------------+
| April 11      | Biopsy of the liver        |
|               | revealed that this mass    |
|               | is not Sam's original      |
|               | cancer but an indistinct   |
|               | mass that will be          |
|               | monitored.                 |
+---------------+----------------------------+

## Victories and concerns

-   We celebrate that a year following the start of treatment, Sam
    is feeling the best he has ever felt. We are incredibly grateful.

-   Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that
    three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been
    removed.

-   The newest growth in Sam's liver is not the original cancer though
    it will be monitored.

-   Ongoing immune therapy has de-regulated Sam's immune system. Side
    effects are becoming dangerous as Sam's liver is inflamed. In order
    to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam's immune system needs
    to be brought back to a regulated state.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

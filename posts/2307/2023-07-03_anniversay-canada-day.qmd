## Highlights from the past few days

This past weekend was spent like many of yours -- celebrating Canada
Day.

Sam's day-to-day health is much improved. To look at him, other than the
thin short hair, your might no know there was anything wrong. Since my
last post:

-   Tina and I celebrated our 27^th^ anniversary! We celebrated as a
    family out for a great meal and then ice cream.

-   Sam had his lumbar puncture and PET scan -- results are pending.

-   Nana (Tina's mom) arrived -- she will be here for the week.

-   Celebrated Canada Day in North Delta where Kevin and Kelsey F. were
    the MCs for the activities there.

-   Townsend reunion with Tina, her mom, her siblings and most of their
    families -- four generations.

## Upcoming

Tomorrow Sam returns to the hospital. We will check in at the day-clinic
where:

1.  We will hear the results of this past weeks scans.

2.  Check blood levels.

3.  Start round 3 (i.e. begin delivery of chemotherapy drugs) --
    assuming blood levels are where they need to be.

Assuming all goes as planned Sam will be admitted tomorrow evening for a
total of five days of chemo-drug delivery.

## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful for my wife!  We have had an amazing journey together though this latest chapter is the hardest we have faced.  I am grateful to be able journey this storm with her.
   
-   Thankful that we are able to take part in normal activities! Happy Canada Day! Great to be with family.

-   Round 3 starts tomorrow.  It has a different drug delivery regime then the last round and impacts will likely it will feel stronger.

-   We are thankful that the treatment is working. There is also concern
    that it is effective to remove the cancer fully.

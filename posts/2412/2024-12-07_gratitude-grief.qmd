## Gratitude

It has been a full two weeks since Sam's memorial. We have been processing a lot as we
continue to move through our grief.

During this time Tina and I have been the recipients of so much love. First, in the weeks
since coming home the community has rallied to meet a really practical need -- ensuring
that we are eating well. It has been freeing to not have to worry about meal planning.

Two weeks ago we had Sam's celebration-of-life/ memorial service ([recording of
service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y0otu8pcxU)).

We are grateful for our community who showed up and conveyed their love and support to us,
our family, and one another. The service itself was beautiful and everyone who shared did
amazing -- you honoured our boy. Following the service we received hugs for two hours
straight. We are grateful that so many people came from near and far to share their love
and support for us. In addition, many shared their support by joining the live broadcast
of the service and sending notes of love to us.

We are grateful for Sam's classmates. Two days following the memorial service, Nov.
25^th^, would have been Sam's 16^th^ birthday. This day could have been a really hard day
but we ended up having something to look forward to: Sam's class from Cedars came to throw
a party. They planned it all themselves and arranged for some adult support where they
needed it. The group arrived shortly after classes ended bringing with them a fully
equipped party. It was exactly what Sam would have dreamed of for a perfect party -- all
his friends in the house playing games, sharing food and cake. It was beautiful to have
everyone here. It was incredible to have our home filled with the joy of Sam's friends.

We are also grateful for friends who are not afraid to share their own grief with us. We
know that we are not the only ones grieving. It is beautiful that our Sam was so loved.

## Grief

*Grief ... is hard.\
Grief ... is exhausting -- mentally, emotionally, and physically.\
Grief ... simply hurts -- it is painful.*

All of the love and support we have received does make life easier. It is important to
know that we are not alone. It has been wonderful to receive the love and support of our
community.

*but ...*

There is a gaping hole in my heart. Some might say it is a Sam shaped hole -- but that is
too nice, too clean. If it is a Sam shaped hole it is a hole where Sam was ripped from me,
all the edges are frayed and torn, and no shape is recognizable. This grief wound is raw
and painful and nothing seems to soothe the pain.

I must learn. I must accept ... that this hole in my heart will be part of me for the rest
of my days.

Yet even now. Even now, I am learning that I can cherish this pain. I do not need this
pain to lessen. I am not even sure I want this pain to become less. This pain is my link
to Sam. How important he was/ is to me.

There is a beauty in the pain. Perhaps, when experiencing this grief-pain, I will learn to
cherish the beauty of this pain -- the love that I have for my boy.

## Recent days

In this time of grief we continue to remain gentle with ourselves. Generally, we are
taking on 1-2 activities in a day. Each day we remain committed to *have a great day. Oh
yeah*! Each day we do. This past week:

-   *Sunday* we made it to church -- this was the first time we actually made it into the
    service and allowed ourselves to engage with the broader community. It was the first
    Sunday of advent and the theme was Hope .... one of the elders spoke of where she had
    seen hope in the world this year and she gave tribute to Sam's courageous hope.
-   On *Mondays* Sam's Grade 11 class has invited us to join them for their lunch break.
    This past Monday we brought Tim-bits and hot chocolate as a token of thanks for their
    gift to us on Sam's birthday. We were again surrounded by the love and energy of this
    class.
-   *Tues. & Wed.* I went to work for the mornings. Tina was at home with her mom,
    facilitating visits for her as it was her first time back to Prince George since
    Tina's dad passed last September.
-   *Thursday* we took Tina's mom to the airport. She had been staying with us the last
    two and a half weeks. It was great to have her here during that time -- good for all
    three of us.
-   *Friday* was more of a day off, just the two of us, resting and starting to figure out
    how to do this new life together. Ended the evening with a dinner out at a friends
    house.

    to care for us.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   We are mindful of friends and families – those that remain in the fight to see their
    children through incredible health challenges (cancer or other). We hope with you and
    we will continue to celebrate your wins!

<!-- -   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of friendship. It was
        incredible to see Sam have time with his friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked,
        played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here
        in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens' Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca). Sam never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for all the days that we lived at RMH.\
    It was a gift to have a place to stay so close to the hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) provided us a home away from
    home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work. -->

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

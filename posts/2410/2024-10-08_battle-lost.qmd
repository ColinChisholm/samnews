Today, in the early morning\
\ \  Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
\ \ racked with disease\
\ \ and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
\ \ our pride, \
\ \ the joy of life that we had with him. 

In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
\ \ to let go,\
\ \ to move on. 

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach. \
\ \ without fear\
\ \ without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
\ \ And jumped into the eternal \
\ \ \ Love of God.

<!-- ## Victories and concerns

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments.

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 19^th^ and 3^rd^ CT scans).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer.

    -   Sam has begun a schedule of oral chemotherapy.
    -   Nivolumab has been shown to be ineffective and use has been
        stopped. ~~He has continued with his immunotherapy -- had
        another dose of Nivolumab (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The
        therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further
        complications that could restrict the use of the drug.~~

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.
    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Surgeries:

    -   A surgery to drain/manage fluid in Sam's left lung (again) is
        being planned for tomorrow (Sept. 26).
    -   Surgery to drain the left-side Pleural Effusion (fluid on lung)
        went well (Sept. 19).
    -   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid
        around his heart – a [pericardial
        effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0).
        We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid
        went well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was
        challenging but Sam has made it through again!
    -   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15,
        see [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The
        outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a
        return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major
        vein).

-   Highs, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days. \`\`\`

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease. -->

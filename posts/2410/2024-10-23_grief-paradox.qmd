## Arriving Home

### Re-entry

amazing to think of when Sam was strong and healthy.<br/>Samuel Justin

We did it -- we got home. We split the trip up over a couple of days
(Oct 18-19). There were periods of many tears on this journey and this
is all so hard. Yet, we are doing it together -- allowing one another to
grieve and cry.

We made it home this past Saturday afternoon.

<!-- We were not sure if we wanted to go home straight away or if we wanted to try to ease-in by staying with my parents for a couple days... By the time we arrived in Prince George it was clear that we just wanted to be home.   -->

Entering our house was one of the hardest things I have done. During
that first hour of being here I thought I might break -- mentally/
emotionally. After more than a year-and-a-half of fighting we were
supposed to arrive home together -- the three of us.

This hurts.

*We were supposed to win.\
We were supposed to return home whole.\
Now we return having lost.\
We returned incomplete.*

*Our mighty warrior died. Everything is wrong.\
And everything in the house reminds us of him.*

### Paradox

The mind is a funny thing. Yes, I felt like I would break. Everything
here reminds me of Sam. Yet that which causes so much grief-pain is also
so full of beauty for the precious memories that they represent. The
picture of us hiking is a great example. I found it on Sunday as I was
starting to unpack and clean up[^1]. Stumbling across pictures of Sam
can cause intense waves of grief -- he is gone and we cannot get him
back. This picture represents Sam when he was so strong a time before
any of this ever happened. It hints at what could have been.

[^1]: Unpacking and cleaning up is not just from this trip but from the
    others when we thought we were returning home. Since April of 2023
    we have lived in our own house a total of 15 days. And when we left
    back then we did not leave the house in-order.

This picture also holds such precious memories and reminds us of
beautiful times. Times of joy and adventure as a family, and good times
with friends. It reminds us of the love that we share.

Being home is a paradox.

*In the moments it can be so hard to be here.\
Yet there is no other place I would rather be.*

*This is our place. Our home full of love. ...\
Though there is pain and the tears still flow\
  they are tears of love.*

### Choices

We are doing it. We are moving through our grief. I have no idea how
long this will take. I only know that the waves come and sometimes very
unexpectedly. Despite this ongoing grief-storm we are continuing to move
forward together. Some of the choices that we are making include:

-   Never fear the tears.
-   Be gentle with ourselves.
-   Accept the love offered. We are starting to engage. We have an
    incredible community loving and supporting us.
-   Extend love. First to one another and then to those that enter our
    lives.
-   Keep taking steps -- sometimes literally.
-   Keep getting outside for activity -- accept the warmth of the sun.

Finally, we make the choice each day: *We're going to have a great day!
Oh Yeah!*



## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard
    work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family
    to gather around us to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as
    we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has
    meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca). Sam never lacked for
    incredible care.

-   We are thankful for all the days that we lived at RMH.\
    It was a gift to have a place to stay so close to the hospital. The
    [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) provided us a home
    away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

## Loss 

We have suffered from an incredible loss.  Rather, we are suffering from the incredible loss of Sam.  
The waves analogy still holds true.  This morning I was doing well but by the afternoon I was a mess -- 
Tina is having similar experiences. I am glad that generally we are not both under the waves of 
grief at the same time.  

There are many times that all of this grief leaves us simply feeling -- lost.

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard
    work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family
    to gather around us to care for us.

-   We are grateful for all of the meals our community is providing

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as
    we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has
    meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca). Sam never lacked for
    incredible care.

-   We are thankful for all the days that we lived at RMH.\
    It was a gift to have a place to stay so close to the hospital. The
    [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) provided us a home
    away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

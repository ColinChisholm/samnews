## A dream

::::: {layout-ncol="2"}
::: {#dream}
Sometime in the middle of the night (\~Oct 5.) Sam woke up. He was
joyful and excited.

> *Mom! I had a dream.*\
> *I was in a race and I won!*
>
> *I won!*

Sam, Mom and I are so proud of you. You did it. You ran your life-race
well. I know that you won!

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard
    work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family
    to gather around us to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as
    we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has
    meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments.

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

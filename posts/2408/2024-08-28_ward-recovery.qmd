Since last post 

F23: Pericardiocentisis 
S24: Most of the day in the ICU.  Everything was calm.  Mostly just waiting.  By the end of that evening we had 
    some concerns regarding how much fluid Sam was retaining.  Nurses Jade (in ICU), and Laura on T8.  Nigel at night.
D26: Dr. Eva - cardiologist visited.  Again told of how well Sam had done in surgery. How beautiful it had been 
    to see his heart re-inflate as the pressure came off. Dr. Cathy, Oncologist on call checked on Sam and in discussion with Tina got some lasix going.  Sam had a rough day.  Frickers tried to visit but he was only willing to see Uncle Kev. Finally, at ~6:00 he was willing to take additional pain meds.  This helped for a bit.  Had to push a little harder for additional meds and a Dr. order to increase pain meds to stay ahead of the pain.  Starting overnight Sam'is now at 90/90 m-eslon plus morphine 5mg Q2 (+15mg every 12)... This amount seems to be effective. Pam was on during the day.  Nigel again at night.
M25: Echo in morning and afternoon.  Cardiology Docs want to leave drain in for the weekend.
    Afternoon meeting with Dr. Jacob.  Cytology is not back.  Lasix through to reduce fluid
    Pam during the day, Maddie at night.
T26: Echo at 8:00am.  Dr. Steven from cardiology, assisted by his fellow, pulled Sam's drain at ~11:00am
    Dr. Peggy following procedure.  Review of meds.  Keep Sam for observation overnight. More lasix to finalize drying him out. 
    Rachelle in the day. Lauren in the night

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Recovery from this latest surgery had its challenges
-   Sam is doing well now and we are hoping to return to RMH by the end
    of the day

## August 29 Update

Sam was discharged on yesterday. We are back at the RMH where all three
of us are catching up on some much needed rest.
:::

I am writing this morning from the hospital. Much of the intensity of
[last week](./2024-08-23_highs-lows-surgery.qmd) continued into this
week -- until yesterday. Yesterday, Sam was able to be disconnected from
all the various lines used during this latest hospital stay.

This morning, my heart was filled with joy. It was such a simple thing:
Sam got up walked to the bathroom and went back to bed falling back into
a restful sleep. These simple actions were beautiful: they were in
contrast to how the previous days had been; and they represented freedom
and health for my boy.

## Looking back

It is hard to believe that it is only day five since Sam had his latest
surgery. Time has moved very slowly as Sam has had to endure new pains,
discomforts, and continuous testing.

I am so glad that Sam had the surgery to remove the excess fluid from
around his heart
([pericardiocentesis](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/tests-treatments-medications/medical-tests/pericardial-drainage)).
Once again the amazing staff at [BC Children's
Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) have saved Sam's life and we cannot
thank them enough.

What is not advertised with surgery is that recovery can take time –
especially if there are any complications. The first night went well,
but I think I will attribute that to the drugs that Sam was on.

By Saturday evening Sam was feeling gross/very uncomfortable. He has
tolerated so much during this journey but he had a hard time with this
procedure. The worst of it was that he had a wire tube in his chest and
that the tube was sitting up against his heart. The tube was used to
continue to drain additional fluid in effort to keep the [pericardial
effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0){.lightbox}
from returning. To complicate his medical picture following the surgery
his fluid balance ... went off.

This meant that he was swollen and puffy (e.g. swollen ankles and
elbows). This was unexpected. Why this happened did not matter as much
as the management of the issue -- the team again did a great job of
bringing his fluid balance back to normal (using IV medications).

## Parent advocacy

It is very important to advocate for your child! The medical teams works
hard trying to solve issues that they are seeing. As parents we see the
big picture. We know what is normal for Sam and when things are not
normal.

In particular, during this past week when it was Tina that drew
attention to various symptoms that Sam was facing and requested
appropriate intervention (i.e. suggesting the echocardiogram that
identified the fluid buildup, and needed fluid management post surgery).
Tina is awesome!
:::

Each day following the surgery Sam would have one and sometimes two
echocardiograms (a specialized ultrasound of the heart) to monitor how
the fluid around his heart was resolving.

### Freedom

Yesterday, metrics of healing were strong enough that Sam could be
disconnected[^1]. The drainage wire was pulled from his chest the hole
was lightly bandaged. The wire was about 5 inches long with at least 1.5
inches were set against the side of his heart – no wonder Sam had been
in such discomfort.

[^1]: metrics included: low discharge volume from drain the prior 12 and
    24 hours, and results of an echocardiogram highlighting very little
    fluid still trapped in the area.

In addition, by the end of the day his fluid balance was looking much
improved and he able to be disconnected from the IV pole overnight.

### Support of family and friends

Our families have been here to support us. The Fricker family was here
on Sunday. Nana has been staying at the RMH while Tina and I have been
staying in-hospital with Sam. Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth were able to see
Sam yesterday, and Uncle Tom along with Daniel and Alex have been able
to have a couple visits.

<!-- New friends Jenn an Eamonn brought RMH dinners to us. -->

We have received numerous messages from friends letting us know that
they continue to care for us. Thank you all for your continued support.
We can't imagine doing this without it.

## Looking forward

It is not clear what all of our next steps are. The past couple of weeks
have focused on very acute issues (i.e. stent surgery and pericardial
fluid drainage). Though the cancer is likely involved in both of these
it was not the focus of treatment.

In the days ahead I expect:

a)  That Sam will be discharged and able to return to the Ronald
    McDonald House and that we will need to stay close to the hospital.

b)  We will have clinic visits to monitor Sam's post surgery progress.

c)  Plans will be made to restart with immune therapy/ treatment of the
    cancer.

## Victories and concerns

-   I think it is fair to say that we are all exhausted -- physically, emotionally, spiritually.

-   Sam had fluid around his heart – a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made
    it through again!

-   We are celebrate the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](./2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome was far
    better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal
    blood-flow!

-   The cancer has grown (based on August 2^nd^ PET scan) and the
    ~~impacts of the disease are threatening Sam's vascular system and
    thereby his life~~ (stent surgery resolved the acute issue).

-   Sam's dosage of Nivolumab will be delayed until his heart issue is
    resolved.\
    Sam is on higher levels of Nivolumab. Side effects of this
    medication include fatigue and agitation of the liver. In the past
    we were not able to use this drug for numerous weeks due to liver
    inflammation. Current support medications are being used to reduce
    negative side effects.

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Scan results show that the cancerous mass in Sam's chest has grown.
-   The cancer is impacting Sam's vascular system and threatens his
    heart.
-   Plans are in place to protect Sam's heart.
-   Nivo dose is quadrupled.
-   Love of friends and family

## Current situation

Last week Sam's cancer journey reached a higher level of intensity. This
has been a hard journey and now it is downright scary. Threats to Sam's
life are incredibly intense. First, there is the immediate
threat-to-life as the cancer has caused significant damage to Sam's
vascular system and now threatens the heart itself. Second, despite the
valiant effort of our medical team and Sam's incredible courage to both
understand and take on the treatments, the cancer itself continues to
grow (see [previous post](./2024-08-07_scan-results.qmd)). Medically
speaking our options are limited -- we need a miracle.

Despite the intensity of the current medical situation in many ways Sam
appears to be healthier than he has been since before this disease
began.

## Medical response and plans

### Maintaining blood-flow

The cancer directly or indirectly has blocked/occluded some of Sam's
major blood vessels[^1]. As a result, blood from his head and upper body
is being re-routed through an extensive network of small collateral
vessels that Sam's body has developed in compensation.

    ::: {#fn-text}
    The left and right bracheocephalic veins are fully occluded. The
    right was occluded when we first arrived due to blood clotting
    associated with the disease. As of last week's scans the left is
    also now fully occluded. Sam's body has adapted rerouting blood
    through collateral vessels. One of these small vessels returns blood
    directly into the Superior vena cava (SVC). Blood return through
    other collaterals is collected by the Azygos vein.

    An additional issue is that the SVC is also partially occuluded
    (\~50%).

    Surgery this week will insert stents to ensure that a) the one
    collateral returning blood directly to the SVC remains open, and b)
    That the SVC itself remains open.

This past week we met with the intervention radiology surgical team.
They have made plans to try to keep Sam's remaining blood-flow pathways
open.

On Thursday August 15 Sam is scheduled to have surgery during which
stents will be inserted to maintain existing blood-flow to his heart.
One will be placed in a small collateral vein that is returning the bulk
of Sam's upper body blood volume. A second stent will be used to keep
the Superior vena cava open.

### Additional scare – ER visit

Given everything that was revealed in the last scan our vigilance has
been increased (can it go any higher?). On Sunday evening Sam started to
have new/novel pains in his chest – at his heart - and strange pulsing
sensations in his neck. So we went into the ER.By the time we arrived
and settled in, Sam's vitals were great. As nothing requiring immediate
intervention could be determined, and given that we had a visit planned
with Sam's medical team the next day, we returned to RMH.

### Disease control

It is unknown if this cancer can be controlled but that does not mean we
will stop trying. In response to the latest scans we will push on and
push harder. Greater risks must be taken. Treatments must be
accelerated.

The original plan was to attempt an increase in Sam's Nivolumab by
doubling the dose. Given the latest results we have chosen to push
harder. Wednesday the dose was quadrupled in an effort to find an
effective dose -- though it will take a few weeks to know if it is
having the desired effect.

In addition, Sam is back on high-dose steroids (prednisone). One of the
primary reasons to use this drug is to quickly reduce inflammation in
the body. Sam has also used it in the past to protect his liver which
the Nivolumab can harm. Within 24 hours of starting the drug it was
possible to visibly see positive impacts.

## Friends and family

This past week it was amazing to have the in-person support of some
friends and family from Prince George. We had great visits and times
that simply felt normal.

Joel, Joanna, and Chase were here for Friday evening and Saturday. We
shared meals, went to a movie (Inside Out 2 – it is great!), made an ice
cream run, Chase and Sam threw a football around, and played some video
games together.

Sunday and Monday my parents came to spend time with us. The effects of
the Nivolumab started to set in on Sunday – causing fatigue. However,
that did not stop us from spending time and sharing meals together. Sam
loved having his grandparents here. Sam seems to be loving his ice cream
these days (could be the prednisone) so to wrap up our time together we
celebrated with an ice cream cake that Sam requested from DQ.

## Victories and concerns

-   The cancer has grown and the impacts of the disease are threatening
    Sam's vascular system and thereby his life.

-   Sam will have surgery, planned for August 15, to install stents to
    protect the blood-flow returning to his heart. This is an unusual
    surgery as Sam's vasculature is abnormal - the most trusted doctors
    with the most expertise to deal with this risky procedure have been
    asked to perform it.

-   Sam is on higher levels of Nivolumab. Side effects of this
    medication include fatigue and agitation of the liver. In the past
    we were not able to use this drug for numerous weeks due to liver
    inflammation. Current support medications are being used to reduce
    negative side effects.

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

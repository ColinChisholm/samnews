Since last post 
15: note: Nana Mary stayed the night at RMH while Sam and I were at hospital 
16: Friday -- left the hospital.  Cal, Chris, Jane were here.  
17: Sat -- a quiet day at the RMH
18: Sun: Driven Project 
19: Mon: Clinic: liver numbers spiked.  Strategy Games and Hobbies -- Tau empire for Sam    
20: Tues: Clinic again: liver numbers had levelled off but still too high for Nivo.
    That evening we went to the Frickers.  In particular Sam was feeling pretty good
    and was able to engage with family. 
    Sam and I returned to RMH.  Had a nice evening getting to bed just after mid-night. 
    Through the night Sam's pain and nausea were high and difficult to manage 
    Together we decided to go to clinic first thing in the morning.

    A precious conversation with Sam.  First at the Frickers (when he had been resting downstairs), and then on the drive back to RMH. Sam admitted his fears that current pains could be related to the progression of the cancer. It was so good / important to have an honest talk.  I discussed with him that this was a logical possibility and that I shared these fears.  I thanked him for sharing.  Despite this, and given that we have no control, we chose not to be anxious about it, to choose courage.  To choose hope.  To trust that no matter what God has him -- though I know that Sam trusts God better than I do right now.  

*pain had been challenging most evening starting Sunday evening -- initially attributed to higher 
output associated with the Driven Project Activities. Pain management was dominantly use of break-thru
morphine. We were also PEG'ing twice daily to manage constipation but we had not been too concerned as Sam was able to pass small amounts*

21: Wed:  To clinic 
    The team jump into action seeing Sam's pain and nausea.  Resting heart rate of 130
    following immediate interventions of IV ondansetron and some other med reduce reflux pain HR settled to 120.
    Numerous tests.  The most telling of which was the echocardiogram which showed a 
    significant pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart).  Cardiology team were a little 
    stunned to find Sam still walking and talking. Plans are in place to re-evaluate and possibly 
    undergo a procedure to remove the excess fluid from around his heart -- 
    Pico S. was given to address the secondary issue of constipation. 
    Onto the ward for observation overnight. 
    Sam was feeling better through the night.  Resting-HR had reduced further to 90

    In the evening Dave and Krista came by! 

22: Thur:  Sam had a good night.  Resting HR trending to normal now at 85 -- though 
    still some chest pain. 
    Cardiac team in for a clinical assessment
    Tests are completed: Echocardiogram, ECG, CT scan (stent placement)
    *Procedure or wait it out...?*

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   We are back in hospital. Sam is currently in ICU following a surgery
    to remove fluid buildup around his heart.
-   Despite the current challenges Sam had a good week with adventures,
    and time with family.
:::

It has been a roller coaster of a week from some good times with
friends, family, and the [Driven
Project](https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/)
experience to the lows of uncontrolled pain and re-admission to the
hospital, and the uncertainty surrounding this distress. Following
surgery yesterday, Sam appears to be recovering well, remains in good
spirits, and we are hopeful that he can be released from hospital soon.

This past week started strong. Since my last post Sam was discharged
following his successful [stent
surgery](./2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd) (Friday Aug.
16). We were not sure what to expect following surgery and Sam did
struggle with various pains and lethargy. Despite this, through the week
we had good visits with family and some big and small adventures.
Saturday (17^th^), Cal, Chris, and Jane were here to visit with Tina and
I (Sam was not yet up for visitors). Sunday, Sam had a huge day taking
part in the [Driven
Project](https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/). Monday
was clinic -- news was not great (see below) but afterwards we had an
afternoon out exploring new games and hobbies at a couple local shops --
it felt almost normal.

By Tuesday Sam was feeling more energetic and we got away from the RMH
to visit family in Whiterock. In his good moments (when not resting away
from the family), it was great to see Sam join in on sharing stories,
laughing, and generally sitting freely with his cousins, Aunt, Uncle,
and Nana. That evening Sam and I returned to the RMH leaving Tina to
enjoy more time with her family.

## Lows

Ack, what a roller coaster this week. Backing up, Monday in clinic Sam's
liver numbers showed a sudden spike upwards. This was confirmed again on
Tuesday. Sam had also started battling elevated pains starting back on
Sunday evening, making sleep difficult. It was Tuesday night that I was
no longer able to keep Sam's pain under control this was also coupled
with nausea. We went to clinic first thing Wednesday morning and the
medical team jumped into high gear, taking bloodwork, and setting up
various tests (Tina joined us mid-morning). By the end of the day it was
confirmed that Sam had fluid pressing on his heart -- a [Pericardial
Effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). By that
point in the day Sam's pain and nausea were under control (IV meds were
far more effective than what I had available), and it was determined to
admit Sam to hospital and reevaluate in the morning.

<!-- Tina gets full credit for knowing the need for and requesting drs. order a echocardiogram -->

<!-- That evening Sam's
prayer was that his heart rate would decrease enough that physical
draining for the fluid would not be necessary. -->

Thursday morning things were looking great! Sam's heart rate continued
to trend downward towards normal levels. It seemed surgical intervention
would not be needed and we would spend a further 24-hours in hospital
for observation. During this evening, it was a great comfort to have
Dave and Krista C. visit.

So many parts of this journey have involved swings. Friday morning we
returned to chaos and uncertainty. Sam's heart rate had been trending
towards normal most of the night but sometime in the early morning it
started building again - returning to significantly elevated levels.


## Surgery & Intensive Care

As I finish writing this post the three of us are in the intensive care.
The day has been very intense but we are now in a good place.
Mid-afternoon, the medical team decided that it would be safest for Sam
to go forward with a surgery to remove the fluid from his around his
heart. By 6:00pm he was in the OR where the doctors pierced through
Sam's upper abdomen and then through the pericardial sac to install a
temporary drain. The surgery went as planned without any complications –
a litre of excess fluid was drained from around Sam's heart. It was good
to have Uncle Cal with us in the anxious waiting.

Sam is a champion. He did the whole surgery under light anaesthetic --
meaning he was awake and aware of what was was happening. Apparently he
chatted with one of the doctors through the whole procedure reflecting
on how great his time at Ness Lake Bible Camp had been.

He is now in the ICU for observation. He is happy, his vitals are much
improved, and he is looking forward to playing games with us and his
nurse this evening.

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam had fluid around his heart – a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well. Sam's vitals are much improved.

-   We are celebrate the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](./2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The
    outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return
    to near-normal blood-flow!

-   The cancer has grown and the impacts of the disease are threatening
    Sam's vascular system and thereby his life.

-   Sam is on higher levels of Nivolumab. Side effects of this
    medication include fatigue and agitation of the liver. In the past
    we were not able to use this drug for numerous weeks due to liver
    inflammation. Current support medications are being used to reduce
    negative side effects.

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

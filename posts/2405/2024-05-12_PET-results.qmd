## Current medical picture 

This past Wednesday Sam had his most recent PET scan.  Scan days are always stressful for everyone. Our experience with this type of stress is not unique.  Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at minimum the day leading up to them are intense.  It is weird because the scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is happening.  They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that we fear.  To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for.  This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.  

The results of this last scan, like many others has mixed news.  

### Cancer status

The good news is that since Feb 5^th^ there are no new disease sites.  The difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam's chest remains active and appears to have grown a small amount.  The previous scan showed no detectable change at that site so to have this small growth strongly suggests that the cancer is still active there.  


### Liver status

The previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active site in Sam's liver could be cancer.  This has been ruled out via biopsy.  We have known for sometime that Sam's liver has been stressed due to his immune system being de-regulated.  Metrics of Sam's liver health have been improving.  

- PET Scan was completed this past Wednesday
    - We celebrate that there are no new disease site 
    - The original cancerous disease site still remains.  Generally, it is mostly stable though this latest scan suggests that there has been some slight growth (i.e. that the cancer is still active).
- Ultrasound 
- Liver 


## Next steps 

- Allow Sam's new immune system to do the work, watch and wait.  However, we do not know if the immune system will be enough to stop this stubborn disease. 
- Considering the use of Nivomulab -- should be effective at making the cancer more visible to the immune system.  However, this medication could also deregulate Sam's immune system that potentially resulting in damage to healthy tissues (e.g. as it was starting to do with Sams's liver this last time).  If this happens Sam would once again need to ramp up the use of immune system suppressing medications thereby making the immune system less effective at battling the cancer -- Catch 22.  

## Rehab and Thank you! 

Despite the challenges that remain in Sam's body he has been feeling good.  
-  Rehab walks and Vietnamese 
-  New record -- cambie villiage
-  Thank you for all of your gifts.  


## Victories and concerns

-   We celebrate that we were able to have a trip home. So good to
    connect with friends and family!

-   We celebrate that a year following the start of treatment, Sam is
    feeling the best he has ever felt.

-   Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that
    three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been
    removed.

-   Ongoing immune therapy has de-regulated Sam's immune system. Side
    effects are becoming dangerous as Sam's liver is inflamed. In order
    to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam's immune system needs
    to be brought back to a regulated state. Recent bloodwork suggests
    that things are returning to normal function.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

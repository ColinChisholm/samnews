## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   PET Scan Results -- Celebrating no new sites. Concern remains as
    disease continues at the original site.
-   Liver numbers are continuing in the right direction.
-   Next steps include a couple options with no clear right choice.
-   We have been able to enjoy life together.

## Current medical picture

This past Wednesday Sam had his most recent PET scan. Scan days are
always stressful. Our experience with this type of stress is not unique.
Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at
minimum the day leading up to them are intense. It is weird because the
scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is
happening. They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that
we fear. To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align
with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for.
This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.

The results of this last scan, like many others, has mixed news.

### Cancer status

The good news is that since Feb 5^th^ there are no new disease sites.

The difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam's chest remains
and has grown a small amount. The previous scan, April 5, showed no
detectable change at that site and so to have this new growth strongly
suggests that the cancer is active there. Options for treatment are
limited and it is unknown if they will be effective.

### Liver status

The previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active
site in Sam's liver could be cancer. This has been ruled out via biopsy.
We have known for sometime that Sam's liver has been stressed due to
side-effects of his immune therapy treatment causing his immune system
to become deregulated. Latest metrics of Sam's liver health have been
improving. Recent ultrasound of the liver shows a minor increase in
size. The Doctors want to continue monitoring this mass as it is not an
urgent priority right now.

## Next steps

We are in a hard place with two potential options for treatment -- it is
not known which is best or if either will be effective.

### Option 1: Rely on the new immune system

Sam's new immune system is fairly well established (although not
completely until about one year after the bone marrow transplant). To
date we have not had the opportunity to see what it can do. The previous
treatments had side-effects that required steroids to calm/ suppress his
immune system so that permanent liver damage could be avoided. If he was
taken off the immunosupressants and just let his own (new) immune system
work, this option would allow Sam to live and enjoy his life without
medications and risk of side-effects. However, we do not know if his new
immune system will effectively battle the cancer.

<!-- and there is no way of
measuring effectiveness in a timely manner (ie. cannot have another PET
scan for 6 weeks, and that is too much time to risk the cancer growing).-->
```
### Option 2: Resume immune therapy

This option would require the use of Nivomulab (an immune therapy drug)
again. We know that this drug can make the cancer in Sam's body
'visible' to the immune system. However, this is also the drug that
resulted in Sam's liver being inflamed and the subsequent need for
steroids to calm the immune system (Catch-22). If we go this route, the
team would use the lessons learned from last time to modify their
therapy plan in an attempt to limit side-effects.

-   If side-effects can be avoided, this will likely be the more
    effective treatment.
-   If side-effects cannot be avoided, this treatment could cause
    permanent harm (eg. the risk of liver failure).

## Life together

Despite all of the challenges and the ongoing threat to Sam's life, we
have been able to enjoy life as a family. The cancer aside, Sam is
healthy, regaining weight, growing, and getting stronger.

In the last couple of weeks we have been instituting Sam's
*foodie-rehab* plan. This is where we walk from RMH to the small mall at
Oak and King Edward. Once there, Sam has been enjoying most items at
Kim's Express (Vietnamese food). One evening Sam led our family for a
larger walk, one that I did not know he was capable of, down to Cambie
Village about 1.5kms away. We had some great ice cream before walking
back. This was an epic evening for our family.

Over this past weekend we were able to join some of the Frickers and the
Townsend side of the family to experience the animals at Aldor Farms
near Ft. Langley. I loved watching Sam take some time to groom Rob, a
huge Percheron work horse.

Yesterday, we celebrated Mothers Day. Ronald McDonald House put on a
beautiful brunch. In the evening, we took in the Canucks vs. Oilers
hockey game (which Sam mostly slept through due to being tired from his
big farm day Saturday).

Tina and I want to express a special thank you to all of you who have
sent funds to assist us in this journey. This extra funding is allowing
us to simply live and enjoy life, meals, and activities together without
needing to worry about a budget. -->

## Victories and concerns

-   We celebrate that a year following the start of all his varied
    treatments, and despite the ongoing cancer battle, Sam is feeling
    the best he has felt in a long time.

-   We are very concerned as the original central mass/ disease center
    is active.

-   Thankful that the three new disease centers, treated using targeted
    radiation, have been removed.

-   Ongoing immune therapy has deregulated Sam's immune system.
    Side-effects were becoming dangerous as Sam's liver is inflamed. In
    order to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam's immune system
    needs to be brought back to a regulated state. Recent bloodwork
    suggests that things are returning to normal function.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

## Current medical picture 

- PET Scan was completed this past Wednesday
    - We celebrate that there are no new disease site 
    - The original cancerous disease site still remains.  Generally, it is mostly stable though this latest scan suggests that there has been some slight growth (i.e. that the cancer is still active).
- Ultrasound 
- Liver 


## Next steps 

- Allow Sam's new immune system to do the work, watch and wait.  However, we do not know if the immune system will be enough to stop this stubborn disease. 
- Considering the use of Nivomulab -- should be effective at making the cancer more visible to the immune system.  However, this medication could also deregulate Sam's immune system that potentially resulting in damage to healthy tissues (e.g. as it was starting to do with Sams's liver this last time).  If this happens Sam would once again need to ramp up the use of immune system suppressing medications thereby making the immune system less effective at battling the cancer -- Catch 22.  

## Rehab and Thank you! 

Despite the challenges that remain in Sam's body he has been feeling good.  
-  Rehab walks and Vietnamese 
-  New record -- cambie villiage
-  Thank you for all of your gifts.  


## Victories and concerns

-   We celebrate that we were able to have a trip home. So good to
    connect with friends and family!

-   We celebrate that a year following the start of treatment, Sam is
    feeling the best he has ever felt.

-   Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that
    three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been
    removed.

-   Ongoing immune therapy has de-regulated Sam's immune system. Side
    effects are becoming dangerous as Sam's liver is inflamed. In order
    to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam's immune system needs
    to be brought back to a regulated state. Recent bloodwork suggests
    that things are returning to normal function.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

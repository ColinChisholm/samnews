Since last post: 

POST: focus on the state of the disease?

R29: @RMH. Sam was much more rested and was able to enjoy the day.  Our for ice cream and JJ Bean, Kaboodals
    I have been able to connect with Landon.  Although a good day Sam powered out by mid-afternoon
F30: @RMH.  Good connection with Landon as we discuss our kids.  
    Cardio clinic including echocardiogram 
    Oncology Clinic: met Dr. Marie-Claude from Canuck.  She suggested that Sam's acid reflux was related to the lack of 
    space in his chest. Juliana and Jacob were there
    Sam explained how he was doing.  He did this wearing flicking the ears on his hat from Daniel and Alex -- very funny for all.  Plans: CT scan on Tuesday. Hope to proceed with Nivolumab on Wednesday.
    Back to RMH.  A relaxed day.  Sam had great energy for the am and clinic but ran out of power for the pm.  Lots of tv and some video games in the afternoon. Sam and I watched Alone.  Later evening Sam had more energy. ... I was done by this point and fell to sleep.
    Tina had a hard evening missing connections/ her people.
S31: Hillhouse family visited: David and Sam talking.  Off to Earnest and Carson's Used Books 
    Sam is enjoying the show Alone
    In the night Sam's chest -- specifically upper sternum was hot
D01: St. John's Anglican Church
    Paul's Omlettery
    Townsends visit -- talks and pizza out at Woodfire Pizza (Cal, Tricia, Jane, Chris)
    ... couldn't believe how much Sam was able to handle! 
M02: Sam had a rough night with lots of additional meds.  We didn't sleep much.  
    It seems the activity of the previous days had caught up with him.
    He rallied by ~3 when the Frickers arrived.  We all had a decent visit (kinda flat)
    Sam seemed to present adrenal deficit a couple times -- after more food and predisone `.5 hours early
    he seemed more alert and engaged. 
    Good evening 
    Sam gaming online with friends: Ben and John; Julia ad Hadance  
T03: CT scan in the am -- straight forward
    Out to Breka Cafe
    Sam gaming online with friends 
    @Clinic 
    Camara and Gaia
    Review of weekend with Jacob and Juliana
    *items to discuss (i.e. Dad's paranoid thoughts)*
    -   Pains -- internal ... itchy on the inside 
    -   Sam style.  I'm feeling good so therefore I will do a lot 
    -   Lot's of joint pains 
    -   Two episodes of what appeared to be adrenal fatigue 
    -   One evening of sweats 
    -   Hot in the chest
    Results:
    -   slight increase 7.1 x 8.1 x 7.3 previous (7.8 x 7.8 x 6.7 August 22)
    -   August 14 7.4 x 6.6 by (7.7 x 6.9 previous)
    -   P. effusion remains small
    Next Steps:
    -   Do nothing as it causes high risk
    -   Give it -- what side effects will we have ... 
    -   Fear of an acute event. 
    -   What do you think:
        -   I would risk an acute event that MAY lead to death rather than no action that WILL lead to death. 
            (not stated: But no action is a death sentence ...)
        -   Sam states well similar 
        -   Tina agrees 
    -   ALternate therapies -- why we are doing what we are doing ... 
    -   Sam stop treatments when when it is definitive that the cancer will not win. 


W04
    *QUESTIONS and THOUGHTS*
    -   The cancer is causing new pain ... elevated pain.  
        We need options for managing it.  Morphine is not enough and does not hit is fast enough.  
        Usually come on the evening. 
    -   This cancer seems to grow in fits and start -- surging.  Is this  known pattern 
        or is it unique. Or is this an artefact of mixed methods.


What a conundrum.  Sam is the healthiest he has been in this journey.  He is able to enjoy life.  He has a thirst for life.  In the early mornings he rolls over and says to me that there is so much that he wants to do (still not sure how conscious he was). He also added ... with you dad!

What Sam wants -- to share of the love and hope he has in Jesus. "Pain is temporary -- hope is eternal."

Once again the cancer has grown but we are still fighting. Tina captured
it really well in her text to some friends and family yesterday evening.

### Treatment review

If you have been following Sam's story you know that in the current
chapter of immunotherapy (i.e. post-chemotherapy,
post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug
Nivolumab has been challenging:

-   When it was first given at the end of February Sam's liver became
    inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it
    again. During this period the cancer grew.

-   Sam restarted Nivolumab in June paired with another drug,
    Ruxolitinib, to control side effects. Sam's body tolerated this well
    but dosing was likely below therapeutic levels. At the beginning of
    August scans demonstrated that the cancer had continued to grow.

-   In the first week of August Sam received a single dose of Nivolumab
    at what was believed to be a therapeutic level. However, by this
    time the cancer was having impacts on Sam's heart. In the weeks
    following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein
    returning blood from much of Sam's upper body to his heart. The
    second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his
    life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the
    effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect.
    Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without
    us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the
    use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these
    surgeries ‚Äì his body needed time to heal.

-   Yesterday's scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in
    tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single
    therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August,
    had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with
    treatment ‚Äì understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds
    this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam.

## Looking back (the past week)

This past week Sam was discharged following his surgeries. Sam has
enjoyed numerous visits with friends and family.

-   Brian, Beth and David were here Saturday
-   Uncle Cal, Aunt Tricia, and cousins Chris and Jane were here Sunday
-   Nana Mary, Uncle Kevin, Aunt Shannon, cousins Kelsey and Kaden were
    here Monday

Sam has also enjoyed connecting with friends online through games and
social media.

<!-- The only downside to all of this activity is that Sam's greatest
physical pains are likely related to all of his activity -- muscles and
joints have ached in the evenings and sometimes through the night. -->

## What Sam wants ‚Äì looking ahead

> "There is so much I want to do, Dad." <!-- [^1]! -->

<!-- [^1]: It was the middle of the night when he said this. I am not even -->

<!-- sure if he was conscious when he said it. -->

1.  To continue treatment ‚Äì we are expecting that he will receive his
    next dose of Nivolumab later today.
2.  Sam is excited about the start of school and re-engaging with his
    classmates and academics at [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca). He wants
    to try to get going with his studies. He is hoping to take World
    History, Christian Perspectives, Math, and Chemistry.
3.  For years Sam has been looking forward to grade 11 and the [YWAM
    Urban Plunge](https://www.ywamvancouver.org/mission-adventures) that
    the Cedars students take. Sam will not be able to travel from Prince
    George with his class but he is looking forward to meeting them here
    and joining in on the activities (that our Doctor must review and
    approve!) and serving the people of East Vancouver.

## Victories and concerns

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 3 CT scan).

-   Sam is looking to fight on despite continued growth of the cancer.
    He will continue with his immunotherapy -- have another dose of
    Nivolumab. It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective,
    and 2) That there will be no further complications that could
    restrict the use of the drug.

-   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the
    waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this
    journey.

-   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around
    his heart ‚Äì a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made
    it through again!

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome
    was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to
    near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

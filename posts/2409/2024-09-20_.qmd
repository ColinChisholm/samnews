Since last post: 

S14 Out to Whiterock 
    - New bible for Sam at Indigo books 
    - Cafe Honolulu 
    - Frickers for football NCAA and UFC 
    - Sam and I returned to RMH while Tina stayed with her mom
D15 Sam and I chill at RMH 
    Tina goes with the family to church in Chilliwack -- incident with KF as he neglected her
    Sam and I drive to Whiterock to get Tina.  
M16 Sam and I play Helldivers together -- He had great energy that morning 
    Clinic -- seemed straight forward.  We do flag low energy... this is explained by activity over the weekend but some concern that something else is going on
    Plans with mom and Dad to have them visit. 
    Sam has little energy in the afternoon 
T17 Sam is tired in the morning but rallies by 11 
    Visit with Tios Dave and Ruth
    Sam has a bleeding hemorrhoid -- took some time to manage.  Arrived at ER at 2:30: bloodwork looked okay but numbers are trending down. X-ray suggested a left sided pleural effusion. 
    Back to RMH by 7:30 
    Brief connection with Janelle and Nova. Call with Mom
    Sam is sad a couple times through the evening

## A full week


## Medical status



## Victories and concerns

-   Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
    friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his friends
    from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have
    lifted/blessed all three of us.

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 3 CT scan).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer. He has
    continued with his immunotherapy -- had another dose of Nivolumab
    (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective,
    and 2) That there will be no further complications that could
    restrict the use of the drug.

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.

    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around
    his heart – a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam
    has made it through again!

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15, see
    [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome
    was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to
    near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein).

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

Since last post: 

W04 Long clinic day (Mahah is Sam's nurse today)
    - Bloodwork 
    - Christina played Mario Kart with Sam.  I think he enjoyed teaching as much as playing
    - Jacob confirms the plan
    - Nivo started
  - Sam visits Oakland and encourages him -- Oakland has a BMT scheduled.
  - Afternoon nap 
  - Franny, River and Emory arrive 
  - WhiteSpot in Kits as a family
R05 A rest day 
    - Nivo seems to be hitting Sam hard.  ... or is it the disease? 
      - Sam is sweaty and achy
      - Tina and I are independently terrified. 
      - I almost broke standing in line for dinner.  All these families they are all going 
        through trauma but they still have their children.  How long will I have my boy?
        Hope seemed lost. 
    - I ran our to Burnaby to get the next refill of Rux.
    - During that time Tina and Sam played a video game! Sam had patience to teach Tina and she did it!
    - Out to Breka. Sam's initiative -- despite how he is feeling.
    - Dave and Rhoda came and visited.  Sam clicks with them so easily.
      - pokemon cards
      - sharing other hobbies (Dave had done them all.)
    - Night: extra itchy (hydroxyzine), ativan for something ..., breakthrough needed for referred pain in back -- disease,
      another effusion -- Sam was no long comfortable to lay on his back.
F06 - slow morning 
    - Clinic and echocardiogram -- no concerns
    - Cal visits -- but Sam is too tired to visit 
S07 - morning ride -- flat tire in Richmond -- Skytrain back
    - slow morning 
    - I am concerned with Sam's lack of activity -- leads to conflict. I think that Sam may also be spending more energy on pain management limiting his ability to live.
    - Frickers and Nana visit.  Fs take Tina out for dinner
    - Sam visits with Nana and does make it down to visit for a 1/2 hour
D08 - Bike ride 
    - Sam chenge meds to 100 / 90 under suspicion that E was being spent on pain management -- seemed to work
    - Sam showers 
    - quiet morning
    - Abbotsford Spaghetti Factory with Cedars grade 11 -- Sam rides bus into Van (6:30 - 9:30).  Before the class arrived we loaded Sam with his afternoon prednisone and a small breakthrough morphine.

## Victories and concerns

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 3 CT scan).

-   Sam is looking to fight on despite continued growth of the cancer.
    He will continue with his immunotherapy -- have another dose of
    Nivolumab. It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective,
    and 2) That there will be no further complications that could
    restrict the use of the drug.

-   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the
    waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this
    journey.

-   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around
    his heart â€“ a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made
    it through again!

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome
    was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to
    near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

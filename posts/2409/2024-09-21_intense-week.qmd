Since last post: 

S14 Out to Whiterock 
    - New bible for Sam at Indigo books 
    - Cafe Honolulu 
    - Frickers for football NCAA and UFC 
    - Sam and I returned to RMH while Tina stayed with her mom
D15 Sam and I chill at RMH 
    Tina goes with the family to church in Chilliwack -- incident with KF as he neglected her
    Sam and I drive to Whiterock to get Tina.  
M16 Sam and I play Helldivers together -- He had great energy that morning 
    Clinic -- seemed straight forward.  We do flag low energy... this is explained by activity over the weekend but some concern that something else is going on
    Plans with mom and Dad to have them visit. 
    Sam has little energy in the afternoon 
T17 Sam is tired in the morning but rallies by 11 
    Visit with Tios Dave and Ruth
    Sam has a bleeding hemorrhoid -- took some time to manage.  Arrived at ER at 2:30: bloodwork looked okay but numbers are trending down. X-ray suggested a left sided pleural effusion. 
    Back to RMH by 7:30 
    Brief connection with Janelle and Nova. Call with Mom
    Sam is sad a couple times through the evening -- most likely treatment will be delayed.
W18 - Clinic first thing including a CT scan -- to provide detail of the pleural effusion, regular bloodwork. Possible surgery to 
      manage the fluid on the lung.  We review the x-ray suggests near ~50% reduction of fluid.
    - Tina and I had wanted a CT -- 
    - Surgery will not be able to happen -- go get away for lunch and come back at 3:30.  
      Family lunch at Granville Island -- despite reduced breathing capacity Sam walks around the 
      market 
    - Back to clinic at for 3:pm to receive results of the CT 
      - The cancer has grown.  Although not causing issues yet, there CT shows that the disease is
        putting pressure on Sam's pulmonary artery -- causing some minor compression.  
      - Nivo will not be given -- evidence suggests this medication is causing more harm then good.  
        Treatment will need to pivot -- next steps will be determined in the days ahead.  
        It is not known if anything will work
    - walk back -- God's got me -- Yes, God has you!  
    - Sam's choice -- the plan go back to the room and break down.  Rather he decides to watch an episode from the Chosen (S1E3) the epidode where Jesus befriends the little children.  Following this his response to everthing in the day is to believe in faith that this all means "Victory".
    - Gram and Papa C. arrive and sit with Sam.  Dave and Rhoda visit 
R19 - I often go for walks in the morning before my family wakes up. On this walk I wept.  The tears 
      flowed freely as I wrestled with developments from the day before.  
    - Jacob and Molly meet us at clinic -- JR has a plan.  He is clear that he does not know if it will work, but he will try. 
    - Sam receives platelets to ensure he does not bleed during surgery
    - Janelle and Nova play games with us. 
    - Sam has surgery -- Molly comes to be his "comfort-nurse"
    - Dr. Hernandez reports the surgery went well. 
    - RMH -- G&P C are with Sam and I. 
    - Coffee out with Aaron.  Tina connects with the prayer meeting. Rose and Nael provide support

These last number of days have been intense and terrifying. I have
limited capacity to write but I will provide the essentials. As such,
many of the details, decision making steps, and personal
thoughts/responses, have been left out.

## Medical situation

We had hoped that Sam would be able to continue with his immunotherapy
with another dose of Nivolumab this past Wednesday. However, this did
not and will not happen.

Sam had mild symptoms of larger underlying issues over last weekend. The
underlying issues would emerge over the following days.

Monday

:   At clinic Sam's numbers (blood and liver related metrics) were
    looking fairly 'ok' and we returned to the RMH.

Tuesday

:   In the afternoon, Sam had a bleed that took some significant time to
    stop. This, coupled with his increased fatigue and pains, gave us
    clarity that we should take Sam to the hospital to be looked at. The
    three of us spent the rest of the day in the ER while various tests
    were being conducted and various doctors were consulted.

:   An x-ray taken during the ER visit highlighted that Sam had a left
    side [pleural
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/pleural-effusion)
    (fluid around the left lung). Given that RMH was so close to the
    hospital, and the situation was not immediately urgent, and that we
    had a clinic visit already planned for the morning, we returned back
    to the RMH for the night.

Wednesday

:   Once at clinic, Sam was sent down for a CT scan to confirm the
    extent of the fluid on his lung to provide the *Interventional
    Radiology* (surgery team) the information that they would need to
    drain it. We took a couple hours off before returning to clinic and
    hearing the results of the scan and next steps.

::: callout-important
### Scan results -- major pivot

1.  The cancer had distinct measurable growth since the prior scan on
    Sept. 2.

2.  This new and unanticipated evidence told us that immunotherapy and
    the use of Nivolumab were not effective at controlling Sam's
    cancerous disease.

3.  Surgery to drain the effusion was scheduled for the following day.
:::

Thursday

:   Back to clinic again. Sam's doctor has a plan for managing Sam's
    cancer. It was a relief to know there would be a plan -- though
    specifics would not be communicated until Friday. The doctor was
    also clear -- it is not known if this new plan/treatment will work.

:   From clinic we went to *surgical procedures* where Sam had his left
    lung drained of fluid. This was without sedation -- local aesthetic
    only. The team took one litre of fluid off of Sam's lung.

Friday

:   Again in clinic. We reviewed the plan for the management of Sam's
    cancer -- a return to chemotherapy. He will be offered similar drugs
    as he was treated with originally. However this treatment differs
    from the original as the drugs will be oral -- this will not hit him
    as hard as previous chemotherapies. The intent of keeping this new
    mode of therapy with generally light impact is two-fold:

:   1.  To protect his already compromised immune system

:   2.  To allow the medical team to more readily switch/adapt
        treatments as they monitor him.

:   This became one our longest clinic visits. Sam had low phosphate
    levels and required an IV infusion to boost him back up. The IV
    infusion took \~7 hours and it was not started until almost 3:pm. We
    spent the evening on the ward as we were there well past clinic
    hours.

## How are we?

Exhausted, scared. To be honest, I cry a lot. Tears will spontaneously
hit me and they flow freely when they do. When the emotion comes it
almost knocks me over. Generally, I am not able to leave Sam alone for
more than 10 minutes at time without my anxiety nagging me to get back
to him.

Sam remains courageous. He has moments of sharing fears and these have
transformed to precious times of the three of us sharing together. He is
tired of being tired. He is looking forward to feeling better and wants
to do so many things.

## Support and moments of relief

We have had moments of relief, of joy, and hope. These have been varied:

-   Precious moments that Tina, Sam and I share.
-   Visits with friends and family. We were blessed with the love of
    numerous people visiting here this week.
    -   Gram and Papa C. arrived on Wed. night
    -   Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth
    -   Janelle and Nova
    -   Dave and Rhoda
    -   Rose and Nael
    -   Aaron W.
-   Many friends who have emailed and texted their support.
-   Our family in the area are waiting for a chance to get in to see us.

## Victories and concerns

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 19^th^ and 3^rd^ CT scans).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer.

    -   Sam has begun a schedule of oral chemotherapy.
    -   Nivolumab has been shown to be ineffective and use has been
        stopped. ~~He has continued with his immunotherapy -- had
        another dose of Nivolumab (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The
        therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further
        complications that could restrict the use of the drug.~~

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.

    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Surgeries:

    -   Surgery to drain the left-side Pleural Effusion (fluid on lung)
        went well (Sept. 19).

    -   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid
        around his heart – a [pericardial
        effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0).
        We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid
        went well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was
        challenging but Sam has made it through again!

    -   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15,
        see [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The
        outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a
        return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major
        vein).

-   Highs, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.

    -    It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days. \`\`\`

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

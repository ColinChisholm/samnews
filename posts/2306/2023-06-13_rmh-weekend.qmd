![A relaxed weekend visiting with family at the
RMH](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2023-06-11_ma-daniel-sam-colin.jpg)

It has been a few days since I have provided an update. The pace of
everything is changing -- for the good. No longer is everyday a new
experience, or sitting in expectation of some procedure. The pace has
slowed and life has become somewhat more predictable.

Sam is currently on day 8 of his second round of chemotherapy. The
medical team really wants to maximize his time away from the hospital 
so, given that he was doing well having received all the medications on
Saturday morning, they discharged him for the weekend! The plan is that
he goes back into the hospital before his blood counts drop too low and
his immune system becomes compromised.

This morning we will go to the hospital to get his blood levels tested
and either be admitted for be sent back out for 48 hours.

## Reflections on ...

We have had a great weekend. Here is a quick recap:

Friday, June 9

:   Was in hospital -- receiving doses of chemotherapy. In the evening
    the most of the Fricker family here. Sam had a good visit with these
    cousins whom he had not seen since before all of this started.

Saturday, June 10

:   The morning was at the hospital for a final dose of chemo drugs for
    this round of therapy. In the afternoon we were out to the Ronald
    McDonald House.

Sunday, June 11

:   The beauty of not being in the hospital is that there are no
    interruptions! Sam and Tina both slept in until mid-morning. At
    about the same time my sister Margaret and cousin Daniel arrived! We
    had a great brunch and visit with them!

Monday, June 12

:   Similar to Sunday, we had another slow day. Margaret and Daniel
    spent some good time with us simply hanging out at the RMH. The five
    of us also managed a short outing to grab ice at the Dairy Queen on
    Main St. Sam is also getting to know another young man here. J. was
    diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks after Sam -- I expect we will
    be connecting with him and his family over the weeks ahead.

## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful for a weekend away! This was a bit of a surprise. I hope
    this can be part of the pattern going forward but we will take each
    day as it comes.

-   Thankful for visits with family.

-   Thankful for a video from the Westwood youth group. Great to see
    familiar faces. Thank you for sending your care and friendship.

-   Concern, that the next week or so could be feel gross as the effects
    of the chemotherapy take hold.

-   We are thankful that the treatment is working. There is also concern
    that it is effective to remove the cancer fully!

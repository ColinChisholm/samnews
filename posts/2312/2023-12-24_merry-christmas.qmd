Merry Christmas everyone! We have so much to be thankful for!

Sam is doing great! Since the last post he has continued to gain
strength. We have a long road ahead of us but it seems we are on the
path towards home and the return to friends, family, school, and work
there.



## The past days

![Sam and I walking from the RMH to the hospital for a clinic visit.  This was the first morning Sam did not need to ride in the chair (Dec. 22^nd^)!](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2023-12_walk-to-clinic.jpg)

-   Sam continues to have regular visits at the clinic. Various blood
    tests are done each time. One specific, the team looks at Tacrolimus levels,
    an immunosuppressant used to ensure that this BMT is successful and
    that any graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is minimized. Note: some
    GVHD is needed so that the new immune system continues to attack any
    remaining cancer.

-   Exciting news! The genetic testing of Sam's immune system confirmed
    that the donor cells have fully replaced Sam's native immune system.
    Ideally, in a BMT transplant the native immune system is removed to
    make way for the donor cells. There is always a chance that some
    native cells remain and that a battle for dominance can occur. For
    Sam, the BMT has gone as planned and all new blood is being
    generated by the donor cells.

-   All of the blood tests have shown Sam's counts have come up and are
    stabilizing.

-   I have debated including this next thought ... especially during
    Christmas. It is a challenging reality (skip it if you need to).

    ## Read

    Christmas at the Ronald McDonald House is amazing but strange --
    layered in hope and pain. There is so much generosity poured into
    this place you cannot help but feel cared for.\
    \
    During these last months, as we have weathered this cancer storm, we
    have also walked beside a number of other families in similar
    circumstances. Some are looking forward to completing treatment,
    while others are in the thick of the storm. 
    Another family, is having an incredibly hard Christmas.
    They have reached the end of possible treatments and recently
    moved to hospice to spend what days remain with their child. Our
    hearts and prayers continue to go out to them. \
    \
    Here at the Ronald McDonald House joys and pains are
    especially visible. For me, this raises an inescapable question for
    life at home. If your Christmas is full of joy, and I truly hope it
    is, are there pains that may be close but remain unseen? Is there
    a way to demonstrate love and generosity into those situations?

-   Some good normal life has been happening.

    -   Sam has had energy to enjoy reading. He finished *The Hobbit*
        earlier this week and immediately got into another book.
    -   Nana was able to visit and help us prepare for Christmas.
    -   We were able to get off the hospital campus and visit the
        Frickers -- with more family visits planned over the holidays.
        So great to play family games... this year games also includes
        some VR which actually has been an amazing physical
        rehabilitation tool.

## Upcoming

-   What a special Christmas this will be! We have seen Sam through a
    long and challenging journey and it seems we are on the other side!\
    \
    *What do I want for Christmas?* I already have it! My son is alive!
    And not just alive, he his beginning to thrive!

-   In the weeks ahead there will continue to be regular visits to the
    clinic as levels are check at medications are adjusted.

-   Numerous scans and tests will start in the new year to evaluate if
    there have been any internal impacts in Sam's body. This will also
    include scans to determine if any disease remains.

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam has completed his critical post-transplant period. He has now
    been discharged from the hospital! We will remain at the RMH for the
    next two months in order to monitor for potential GVHD
    complications.

-   Sam continues to regain strength. He is now able to walk from the
    RMH to the hospital.

-   New blood cells in Sam's body are all from the donor! Sam's bone
    marrow is pumping-out/generating new blood! The engraftment process
    is working! We have seen Sam's numbers come up and now stabilize!

-   Sam will still be considered immune compromised for the months ahead
    and mostly susceptible to viral infection. It remains to be flu
    season and covid is still out there. We must continue to be vigilant
    to protect Sam.

-   We very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the
    donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation *I cannot thank
    you enough*.

-   We are thankful to the medical team who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great
    confidence.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We are thankful for all of the messages of encouragement and
    solidarity that we have received from all of you.

-   There is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease.

On Dec. 12^th^ Santa paid a visit to the BC Children's Hospital. Sam was
able to welcome him onto the oncology ward. Tina and Nana Mary (1:03)
were also able to meet him. Tina did an amazing job of sharing what this
Christmas means to us (starting at 1:13). The original news article from
the CBC is [linked

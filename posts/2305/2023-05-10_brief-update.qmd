I'll keep it brief this morning. We are now in preparation mode for the
next round of chemotherapy. It will hit hard, but I will describe that
within the next couple days. There are a number of steps that need to
occur before we begin -- I have included these below

## Concerns and victories

1.  We are very thankful for the entire medical team here. The care-aid
    and nurses take on the day-to-day care, each with their own style of
    care but all doing a great job of addressing needs as they arise.
    The support teams including IV, nutrition, and physio. The cleaning
    staff who are so polite. Sam's doctors who are excellent
    communicators and are gracious in allowing time for dialogue and
    answering our questions when they have answers, and are straight
    with us when they do not know.

2.  There are a lot of unknowns going forward. Sam's form of cancer is
    mostly unknown. As such, the treatment plan / chemotherapy will be
    to hit it with the largest hammer available. This will be hard on
    Sam's body and we hope much harder on the cancer.

3.  In preparation, another attempt to establish a central-line will be
    made. As the clotting in the chest blocking access via the arms
    towards the heart a line will be attempted through the vessels in
    one of Sams's legs, to approach the heart from below. Once this line
    is established chemotherapy will begin. Timing will be based on the
    next available time... this may be as late as Friday.

Integrity has always been one of my/our core values. That what we do and say aligns with
what we think and believe. Yet I reflect on my current state of life and I am left to
wonder if I have fallen into a dual-life: One life of loss; the other life of finding a
new way of living. These lives don't seem to align and this incongruent-living can lead to
feelings of guilt. I think I have this sort out better now ... the thoughts below were
part of doing that.

Why is it that all these months later that the pain of loss seems to grow. This is likely
a wave. The emotional waves remain strong rising to the same highs and lows... though the
violence of the transitions is not as sharp.

Over there last month there have been many days that I need to spend time crying before I
continue on with the rest of my day. There is no right way to cry. My cries are quiet as
tears escape my eyes. In contrast, Tina's cries are can be wails. Our individual responses
to greief are consistent with who we are and though we grieve individually, we also grieve
together.

Despite these grief-pains we continue to push on -- to live life. Tina continues to 
volunteer at Sam's school.  She love connecting with the staff, other parents, and especially with Sam's classmates during their lunch break once a week.  This lunch-club is a highlight for her as well as
the students.  Tina remains Tina -- pouring out love to people.  

I have been able to enjoy my work -- now at ~3/4 time.  I have a great team, and we take on interesting and challenging problems.  Earlier this week we had a day was filled with meetings with other organizations.  I could not help but enjoy them and all the different conversations and the ideas exchanged.  I know Sam would have been proud to hear about it -- he was always proud of his working-Dad.  To have a day like that results in a backlash  and by the end of the day I faced an emotion that has been more and more common.

I felt guilt.  Guilt when I enjoy my work.  Guilt when I I find joy in life.  Guilt when my grief-pains fail to hold me back from living.  Reflecting on my day filled with meetings, unless people knew our story, I expect no one would have been able to tell that anything was wrong.  But Sam is gone and therefore everything is wrong. 

Do you see it? The dual-living? 

One life where we learn to have joys, find satisfaction in our tasks, where we seem to
live well without Sam. The other life with our loss is near-all-consumingly present and to which I now add feelings of guilt.  It has been hard to accept the conflict/ dissonance of these two ways of living.
It seems like I am not being true -- that I lack some level integrity.  

I discussed these ideas with my counselor.  It was a really freeing session.  In that group's practice they have a model of grief that lines up incredibly well with what I have been thinking.  Their model of grief presents the need to live in two spheres.  One in the sphere of loss.  The other is the sphere of restoration (i.e. restoring/rebuilding life-without).  As we work through our grief it is neither possible or healthy to live in one or the other.  Rather we must move between these spheres. 

As I reflect on our journey since losing Sam, I see the early times when our time was dominated by loss and only with extreme effort and guarding of our hearts was it possible to exit that sphere for a few hours.  

Now I find it easier to move between these spheres of loss and restoration.  There are times when the pain of loss 


It is not possible to live in loss. Yet it is not possible to live without the loss. We
must live and we must grieve.

In our early grief it was not possible to live outside of the sphere of loss. Now I find I
can also have hours in a sphere of living without

We are thankful for our community they continue to gather around us, to care and support.
They are beautiful people...

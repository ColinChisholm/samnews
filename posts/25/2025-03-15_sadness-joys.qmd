I wrote this last week, on March 8^th^, but I needed to let it sit with me for the week...
Perhaps to confirm I believed it ... not sure exactly.

Though our sorrow from losing Sam remains, yet, now there are moments of joy in the mix
with more of a freedom to remember the beautiful life and love that we shared.

*March 8, 2025*

This post has been developing in my mind over the last couple of weeks. Today, the
concepts need to be captured before they begin to slip away. Grief continues to be hard
work. Writing this is hard and I am pushing myself to gather the energy to get my thoughts
onto this page.

It is a sad-Saturday. This day feels harder than most in the last couple weeks. I do not
have a specific reason for today's sadness. There have been no specific triggers. Neither
does this sadness worry me. This grief-sadness is simply part of our journey. I simply
accept it. There remains a beauty in it, as it ties me to the love I/we have for Sam. Oh
how we miss him.

In contrast to today's sadness, I also recognize that over the last couple of weeks there
have also been moments of joy.

## A dream

I don't consider myself a dreamer and I rarely remember my dreams. Even when I do remember
them, I do not consider them to be important or meaningful.

On the morning of Feb. 13, I woke from a dream that would cause me to reflect/ contemplate
for the following weeks. This dream was important.

In my dream: I was back at Sam's bedside the morning he died (similar to my [last
post](./2025-02-06_broken-but-building.qmd)).
This was the place where part of me has remained -- the time and place that part of me has
refused to let go.

The difference in this dream was that I was not visiting Sam in the hour before he died
but in the hour after. Sam was dead and I remained at his bedside. My soul wailed:

> *"Sam, I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that you are a memory. I love you."*

And in my dream Sam was there -- in spirit. And he answered my cry. He said:

> *"It's okay Dad. I love you too."*

I would continue to wrestle with this dream for the next couple weeks. I was unsettled.
Sam is far more than a memory. Our hope and faith is that we will see him again. But
though I may long for that time, I do not live there/then. I live here and now, in this
present life.

In working through this dream I have come to a deeper acceptance that Sam is gone. My
conscious mind has known this all along, but my deeper self has needed to come to grips
with this new reality. This deeper acceptance has also allowed for greater freedom to
remember.

Freedom to remember and even find joys in the memories. We will cherish all the days that
we were able to share with Sam.

## Simple memories. Simple joys.

My joyful memories do not have to be the big events that we experienced together. Rather I
am finding joys in the simple memories of life. Like how Sam loved pizza. How Sam loved
his family and his friends.

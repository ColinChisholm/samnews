![A few of our visitors -- so great to have you
here!](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2023-10-20_visitors.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my last post I tried to keep things to a clinical picture. Here I
will attempt to capture a little of what it is to live through this
cancer journey and to provide more detail on what the upcoming process
may look like.

From the latest results, [last post](./2023-10-15_Results-round-6.qmd),
It feels like we are walking along a knife's edge separating life and
hope on the one side, from doubt, fear, and death on the other. This is
not simply a feeling. This is a reality as the results are not great,
though they are good enough to keep going.

## ~~Good results?~~ Good *enough* results

Are the results good? Yes -- in that we get to keep going, and that
there is hope that the treatment will work. However, there are no
assurances, and Sam is not in an ideal state for entering the next
phases of treatment.

Sam's cancer is unique, and our medical team is using their best
judgment, but none of them have battled this cancer before. They have
found a single reference to it, but that has only provided a little
guidance.

The medical team is battling hard for Sam and their strategies to date
have initially reduced, and more recently kept the cancer from growing.
However, compared with known cancers this cancer has not responded as
well as any of us have wanted.

## Not an ideal plan

We are moving forward with a bone-marrow-transplant (BMT), but we are
not in an ideal situation. Ideally, and for best results, when moving to
BMT the medical team would like the cancer to be non-detectable. With
Sam, starting from where he was back in April, the cancerous mass has
been reduced in size, but a significant mass remains. It is not operable
as it is in the lymphatic system; although it can be located, as I
understand it, it is too amorphous and intertwined within his healthy
tissues and bear vital organs (e.g. heart and lungs).

### Challenges ahead

In the weeks ahead Sam will be facing a number of challenges (see [The
Plan](/plan.qmd)).

Radiation therapy -- phase 1: *Targeted radiation*

:   The objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as
    much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges.
    The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer
    while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to
    radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain
    -- think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that
    sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most
    in his throat.

Radiation therapy -- phase 2: *Total body irradiation (TBI)*

:   Next, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI).
    This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken
    to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI
    has the objective of permanently destroying Sam's native immune
    system so that his immune system will not compete with the
    transplant.

:   There is a long list of potential side effects from the two
    radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of
    the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to
    metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can
    be scary.

:   This step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark
    a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant
    must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.


BMT Chemotherapy

:   The previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and
    removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different
    objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam's
    own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that
    produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam's bone marrow
    will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy
    drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.

The transplant/graft

:   On Nov. 14^th^ Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow.
    The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start
    providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following
    receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that
    the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take
    place in an isolation room -- Sam will not be allowed to leave until
    his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up
    and be with him.

:   This will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will
    likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he
    will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain,
    nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition,
    and then potentially additional medication should he become ill
    without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these
    supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to
    all be connected at once. His current central lines should support
    most of this.

:   Once the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam's new immune
    system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer.
    However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be
    taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam -- potential graft
    versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to
    continually attach the cancer.

## Choosing hope

There are many reasons to be consumed by fear -- to allow the beast of
Despair to have a foothold in our lives. Sure we have our moments of
anxiety -- but we choose hope. Sam remains a champion. We have also laid
out some great ideas for his time in isolation -- I hope he will feel
well enough to take part in the activities we have planned.

We invite you to choose hope with us. It does make this journey easier
knowing that you are there with us in mind and spirit. Please continue
in your commitment to care and prayer.



## Highlights from this past week

Visits

:   David and Beth H. came down. So good to see Sam be able to spend
    time with a friend in person!

:   We invited Nana over for a sleep-over. Although she now lives in the
    area it was great to have her here with us like before she moved.

:   Gram and Papa C. arrived yesterday evening. Great to have them here
    and have their in-person support.

Sam's Energy

:   We have not seen Sam have this much energy since well before we left
    home. The cancer has been set back and he has had a week long break
    between treatments. It definitely shows how the chemotherapy has
    been relentless.

:   Sam has had renewed energy to take on some academics, to build Lego,
    to tease his parents (...I am happy about that? Right?...). So good
    to see him have more physical and mental capacity.

## Victories and concerns

-   It has been amazing to see Sam out from under the influence of
    chemotherapy. To see him return to strength of mind and to have
    capacity for more activity.

-   We have completed a major chapter in Sam's treatment. With the
    completion of this last/ sixth round of chemotherapy we now pivot to
    the bone marrow treatment plan -- this next treatment brings hope of
    removal of the disease but also anxiety about both the challenging
    process and the potential for long term side effects.

-   It is the beginning of flu season and covid is still out there. In
    the weeks ahead, as a family, we will be very cautious to reduce our
    risk of getting ill. If any of us get sick in the weeks ahead it
    will add challenges to Sam and the BMT process as he will be
    entering a phase where he has no immune system for weeks.

-   We are continually thankful for our medical teams here. They
    continue to provide incredible care. They are always open to
    conversation and answering questions. They have been incredibly
    pro-active and I am glad we are prepared for the next steps.

-   Thankful that the chemotherapy has been effective at initially
    reducing the cancer and lately keeping the cancer contained (as
    indicated by the PET scan). Thankful that these results allow us to
    move forward.

-   In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to
    come together:

    1.  Due to some timing and logistics we have had to change donors.
        We are thankful for this current donor who will provide a
        peripheral blood sample and is a good match for Sam.
    2.  We are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term
        would be limited. *Ideally, that there would be no measurable
        side effects long term*.
    3.  The medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them.
        All the pieces need to fall into place for the best timing
        possible.

-   We are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for
    your notes of encouragement.

-   There is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease.

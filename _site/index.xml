<p>It has been six weeks since Sam died. Six weeks without him. Not a day goes by where we do not miss him.</p>
<p>Sam’s memorial service is just five days away. I have been going through our pictures to share with everyone.</p>

<p>How can I even begin to capture and communicate his life. … I have to accept the pictures for what they are – simple snapshots. Snapshots that are limited to mere moments of time providing limited windows into Sam’s life. Our life with him. His life with friends and family.</p>
<p>Sam’s life was rich. He was deeply loved and he also loved freely.</p>
<p>Though my heart aches for him each and everyday that goes by I remain proud of him. I remain proud of who he was and the man that he was becoming. Oh that I could have seen more.</p>

<p>I know it has not been very long since Sam died but I did not imagine that the grief-pain would be so bad. I consider how I am doing and everything ends with the suffix: <em>sad</em>. Some of how we experience our grief:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sad-sad</em> which for me means I don’t want to be with anyone. I hide and I cry. Tina’s experience of this is different – she needs to share her sadness and as much as I withdraw she seeks people out to share the sadness. Though different both are real ways that we experience <em>sad-sad</em>.</li>
<li><em>Happy-sad</em> when we hold a precious memory of Sam and can have some measure of joy in the memory though our hearts still ache for our boy.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Angry-sad</em> when I am angry at the situation. When my mind rails at the injustice. Sam’s death is just wrong. This is not a place that I want to live – though I have to admit it does give me more energy to get some things done than the other sad-types</li>
<li><em>Unclassified-sad</em> the wave of sadness that seems to have no source, no outlet, a wave that threatens to pull you down but you don’t have a clue where it is going.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit that I do have periods, an hour here or there, where I am not conscious of my grief. However, when this happens there is almost always a strong backlash. It is like the grief just builds up waiting for its turn and hits like a flood.</p>

<p>It has been four weeks since Sam died. Tina and I have been home for just over two weeks.</p>
<p>Life remains hard, incredibly hard at some times. Yet, there is also good.</p>
<p>These days over the last weeks have almost had some rhythm to them. Emotionally, our days typically start with a general sadness at the loss of Sam and through the morning the waves build such that we feel the acute pain of losing him – that his presence is missing in our home. Throughout the day, It is not surprising but the experience is shocking, new waves can hit at almost anytime and without warning. These waves of grief may have specific memories associated with them – sometimes they come without explanation. It is in these waves that our tears flow and we give each other the freedom to cry.</p>
<p>In parallel to these teary times, we have a morning routine of sharing coffee, reviewing, and building plans for our days. Despite the waves we push on – together. Each day we continue with:</p>
<div class="center">
<p><em>We are going to have a great day – O Yeah!</em> <sup>1</sup></p>
</div>
<p>And we do.</p>

<p>There is no way around it. The loss of Sam is incredibly hard. We love him so much and we have lost our ability to communicate that love. … And so we cry.</p>
<p>The grief is also of all the lost hopes. The loss of things we planned to do with Sam. The loss of dreams we did not even know we had for him but when confronted with life events our hearts cannot escape – <em>Oh how I wish we could have seen Sam …</em> fill in the blank… And so we cry.</p>
<p>The grief often leaves us feeling lost.</p>

<p>Despite these pains we have continued to move forward each day. We have done this together. We have also done this with the support of our community – incredible friends and family who are making a point of being with us. They invite us or allow us to invite them into one another’s lives. In these days since we have come home we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gotten out for walks. In the neighbourhood. In the woods. Sometimes just the two of us. Sometimes with friends. Sometimes with Sam’s friends.</li>
<li>We have paused to open beautiful messages or cards reading how Sam was loved and how we continue to be loved and cared for.</li>
<li>We have gotten together with friends and family to:
<ul>
<li>Share coffee or meals.</li>
<li>Celebrate a birthday.</li>
<li>Play games.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are moments when getting together can feel ‘normal’ – but they are not. Yet our community is so gracious with us. We all pause to recognize that life is not the normal that any of us wanted. A huge part of our lives is missing.</p>
<p><em>These pauses are important.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Important for Tina and I to share our pain and in doing so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;allow friends and family to carry it with us.<br>
These pauses are important.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Important to allow our people to express their pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for our entire community feels the pain of Sam’s absence.</em></p>
<p>There is a solemn beauty in sharing our grief together.</p>
<p>Although we hurt we are blessed with many beautiful caring people.</p>
<p>Sam is loved. We are loved.</p>

<p>We did it – we got home. We split the trip up over a couple of days (Oct 18-19). There were periods of many tears on this journey and this is all so hard. Yet, we are doing it together – allowing one another to grieve and cry.</p>
<p>We made it home this past Saturday afternoon.</p>
<!-- We were not sure if we wanted to go home straight away or if we wanted to try to ease-in by staying with my parents for a couple days... By the time we arrived in Prince George it was clear that we just wanted to be home.   -->
<p>Entering our house was one of the hardest things I have done. During that first hour of being here I thought I might break – mentally/ emotionally. After more than a year-and-a-half of fighting we were supposed to arrive home together – the three of us.</p>
<p>This hurts.</p>
<p><em>We were supposed to win.<br>
We were supposed to return home whole.<br>
Now we return having lost.<br>
We returned incomplete.</em></p>
<p><em>Our mighty warrior died. Everything is wrong.<br>
And everything in the house reminds us of him.</em></p>

<p>The mind is a funny thing. Yes, I felt like I would break. Everything here reminds me of Sam. Yet that which causes so much grief-pain is also so full of beauty for the precious memories that they represent. The picture of us hiking is a great example. I found it on Sunday as I was starting to unpack and clean up<sup>1</sup>. Stumbling across pictures of Sam can cause intense waves of grief – he is gone and we cannot get him back. This picture represents Sam when he was so strong a time before any of this ever happened. It hints at what could have been.</p>
<p>This picture also holds such precious memories and reminds us of beautiful times. Times of joy and adventure as a family, and good times with friends. It reminds us of the love that we share.</p>
<p>Being home is a paradox.</p>
<p><em>In the moments it can be so hard to be here.<br>
Yet there is no other place I would rather be.</em></p>
<p><em>This is our place. Our home full of love. …<br>
Though there is pain and the tears still flow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they are tears of love.</em></p>

<section id="choices" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>We are doing it. We are moving through our grief. I have no idea how long this will take. I only know that the waves come and sometimes very unexpectedly. Despite this ongoing grief-storm we are continuing to move forward together. Some of the choices that we are making include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never fear the tears.</li>
<li>Be gentle with ourselves.</li>
<li>Accept the love offered. We are starting to engage. We have an incredible community loving and supporting us.</li>
<li>Extend love. First to one another and then to those that enter our lives.</li>
<li>Keep taking steps – sometimes literally.</li>
<li>Keep getting outside for activity – accept the warmth of the sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we make the choice each day: <em>We’re going to have a great day! Oh Yeah!</em></p>

<p><em>2024-10-18</em></p>
<p>These are hard days. Yet we are managing. We are committed. Despite our pains we keep choosing to have great days.</p>
<p>We choose to keep sharing love to one another and to those we connect with during the day. We do not fear our tears but let them flow when they come. We choose to keep moving, keep placing one foot in front of the other – literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>The days ahead will be particularly hard. They hold the large steps. We are transitioning – making our return home… Yet it will never be what we hoped. We must learn to dream new dreams… In time.</p>

<p>It is the early morning. Sam passed four days ago.<br>
The cancer storm has swamped us. It has taken our beloved son.</p>
<p>The storm continues – it is just given a new name: <em>grief</em>.</p>
<p>The waves hit us. At times it can feel that we will never catch our breath. Yet, we are learning. These waves will come and go. We accept them. We must be gentle with ourselves.</p>
<p>We recognize the tears that we shed are actually beautiful for they are the love that we have for Sam. The love that we have for him has not stopped but we do not have a place to put it – for we cannot reach him. So we cry. Sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly, sometimes my whole body shakes.</p>
<p>In time we will learn to ride these waves of grief, to allow each wave in to become a remembrance of sombre-joy. … In time.</p>
</section>
<section id="courage" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="courage">Courage</h2>
<p>It was a simple few words spoken between Tina and Sam the morning before Sam died. Tina was getting herself ready for the day and exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>We are going to have a great day!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam was quick to respond:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Oh Yeah!</em> (said in a very raspy voice – using intense effort).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These simple words have now become how Tina and I begin each day.</p>
<p>Sam was amazing! He remained courageous to the very end. Having a great day did not mean that he was free of pain. It did not mean that he was even mobile. In reality he was extremely sick. He could barely move. He could barely speak as the cancer compressed his airways. But he was committed to having a great day. And he did – everyday.</p>
<p><em>How did he? What made his days great?</em></p>
</section>
<section id="love" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="love">Love</h2>
<p>Despite his disease Sam kept loving people. He also freely accepted the love poured out to him.</p>
<ul>
<li>He hosted friends – greeting them, talking with them as he was able, taking part in whatever form of fun was to be had (eg. an “ice chip party”!)</li>
<li>He loved hearing the notes of encouragement and support sent to us.</li>
<li>He welcomed his medical team. He accepted their loving care. Was thankful to them.</li>
<li>He enjoyed the love poured out to him by his family (Grandparents, Cousins, Aunts and Uncles).</li>
<li>As a family of three we loved each other well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fact that physically Sam was so weak his heart/love capacity remained so strong.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-commitment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-commitment">Our Commitment</h2>
<p>Tina and I have committed to keep having great days – despite our circumstances, despite our pains. We will keep loving and we will allow our hearts to remain open to receive gifts of love given. This is a choice, a discipline that takes effort.</p>

<p>Today, in the early morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tina and I sat with Sam.<br>
</p>
<p>Despite his body being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;racked with disease<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and his near inability to communicate,</p>

<p>We expressed our love,<br>

He moved beyond our reach.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;without fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;without pain or suffering.</p>

<!-- ## Victories and concerns

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments.

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 19^th^ and 3^rd^ CT scans).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer.

    -   Sam has begun a schedule of oral chemotherapy.
    -   Nivolumab has been shown to be ineffective and use has been
        stopped. ~~He has continued with his immunotherapy -- had
        another dose of Nivolumab (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The
        therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further
        complications that could restrict the use of the drug.~~

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.
    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Surgeries:

    -   A surgery to drain/manage fluid in Sam's left lung (again) is

    -   Surgery to drain the left-side Pleural Effusion (fluid on lung)

        outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a
        return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major
        vein).

-   Highs, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days. \`\`\`

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease. -->

<!-- 
Since last post: 

D22 Oncology calls -- the fluid from Sam's pleural effusion was infected ... need to come in to get antibiotics 
    - In through the ER: bloodwork, an xray -- effusion has returned in part
    - Up to the ward 
    - Gram and Papa are here
    - NFL football 
M23 On Ward  -- Issy during the day, Maria at night
    8:00 Sam wakes lightly -- the heels of his feet are sore so I rub them but I can't stop quietly crying.  Sam's eyes are closed as he rests and his lips are pasty white.  
    8:45 I prep'd toast with PB&J.  Sam is happy and resting.  "I'm happy" "Just resting"
    10:15 Pet therapy comes by.  Sam pets Simba a big Golden Doodle.  He is chocolate brown. His size and facial expressions are much like Buddy 
    10:35 How are you feeling?  Chest and sinus infection as well? Sam settles in for a rest. 
    11:00 Sam is resting
    12:00 Sam is feeling better and he wants to set up his laptop to play 
    13:00 Sam and I play Hell Divers 
    15:00 Walk down the hall
    16:00 Peggy comes by to check on Sam.  If effusion is cancer-mass related draining it will not help.  Various cultures will be checked. 
          One of the antibiotics can be hard on the kidneys -- make them process slowly. 
          Monitor for a couple days 
          QofL -- O2 supply outside is hospital is possible. 
          I fear that we have no choice but to let his lung capacity fall -- unless drains are installed.  
          Lasix to be given.
    17:20 NFL football with Sam, Gram, and Papa (what time did they arrive?).  Gram massages Sam's feet
    ~18:00 Tina and I talk with Jacob, review details: Treatment and also Quality of Life
           Effusion caused by infection, Nivo, but most likely the cancer.  It is not understood why cancer 
    ~18:30 Jacob talks with Sam 
    ~19:00 I walk Gram an Papa out 
    ~20:00 Dinner via door-dash; watch Alone together 
    ~22:00 Sam and Tina:  baking show

    Aches and Pains 
    - Apparent bladder infection -- hard to pee (previously attributed to morphine) also now painful to pee (as of yesterday afternoon)
    - Tight chest -- chest infection ... did Sam cough something up? 
    - Headache -- sinus infection? 

T24 On Ward -- Jaylyn in the day, Crystal at night
    07:00 "Oh hey dad", "I had the best sleep" ... before falling back to sleep.  Every moment is precious -- 
          I wish I could hold a moment in time yet it slips so quickly away.  I fear Sam is slipping too quickly away. 
    08:30 Mom went to the clinic.  Sam looks so happy about that.  It gives him peace as he had anxiety about her health.
    ...   Sam rests most of the morning 
    11:30 Awake-ish a little concern that he is slow and slurring ...I take a nap as I could not stay warm
    12:30 Sam and Mom watch baking show. 
    16:30 Jacob comes by to check on Sam and the four of us play Kingdomino -- Sam proves that he remains sharp. 
    17:00 ~ Molly stops by to tell us about her new job ... but she will remain Sam's nurse.
    18:30 Sam is brighter, Jaylyn has provided a nose moisture machine, following a stretch Sam's 
          lungs seem to have expanded and he is able to get over 92... short lived.
    19:00 Starting to watch the hockey game (Canucks vs Seattle -- preseason).  I enjoy seeing Sam enjoy the game.
    19:30 Frickers and Nana arrive.  Tina visits with them in the Family lounge.  Gram and Papa C leave as F and Nana
          come in.  ~10 mins later they leave to settle MAry into the RMH. 
    20:30??? Sam has a massive poop, including a bleed.  It is the after effects that are hard -- it is like his whole upper 
          body starts to spasm.  It took an hour or so to get it under control.  Crystal was a great help.

W25 On Ward -- Pam in the day
    06:45 Sam is up to pee but starts coughing causing pain and nausea.  I return from a walk to be with him and Tina.  
          Ativan and IV gravol help settle things down.  Pam's confidence is re-assuring. 
    07:38 Tina and I are able to sit with Sam each holding a hand as he is resting.  How many days or hours do 
          we have left to simply be with him like this? 
    08:15 I capture from 22:30 ysterday till now.  Sam is resting nicely.

<p>Sam continues to receive amazing care.</p>
<p>Although Sam’s surgery was delayed, he was able to go in first thing this morning. Everything went according to plan and he and was out again within the hour.</p>
<p>The surgery seems to have gone well draining almost a litre of fluid from the pleural space of his left lung. Sam is breathing easier and has nice colour in his cheeks and lips.</p>

<p>Although a faint glimmer of hope remains we must prepare ourselves for the worst.</p>
<p>I feel the need to be present for each precious moment. Every simple sentence of <em>“Hi Dad<em>”, </em>”I’m happy”</em>, or <em>“Just resting”</em> is a precious treasure. I want to hold each moment but they too quickly slip into the past and instantly start to fade. I grieve as each treasure slips past me. Oh that I could stop time and live with each one.</p>
<p>Be ready, the next moment, the next treasure is coming. How many more do we get? Do we have weeks? Days? I want a lifetime of them.</p>
<p>We are living in a time warp – time is slow but still moves far too fast.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>

<dt>Sunday</dt>
<dd>
<p>The oncology team called and asked us to come into the hospital as the fluid that was around Sam’s lung had bacteria in it and he needed to start a round of antibiotics. The truth is we likely would have come in by the end of the day anyways – Sam was having a harder time breathing and was retaining fluid.</p>
<p>Being the weekend we had to enter the hospital via the Emergency Dept. The team there got some initial tests done. A chest x-ray showed that the left side pleural effusion (fluid around the lung) was starting to build up again. Anitbiotics were started.</p>
<p>In the early evening we were transferred up to the oncology ward where we settled in. This place is familiar and the team does a great job of ensuring Sam is cared for. Despite sleeping on the pullout-bed, I had a better sleep than I had the nights before, as we had professional backup in nurses that we knew and trusted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>
<p>The main issue being addressed during our days here is that Sam has reduced airflow – definitely influenced by the pleural effusion but this may also be caused by the cancer.</p>
<p>With reduced lung capacity Sam is on supplemental oxygen. Before any procedures are planned for managing the fluid in his chest the team needs to better understand what is causing it. Options include: an infection, or impacts of the cancer (see below). If the effusion is related to an infection the use of antibiotics should start to resolve the issue. If it is caused by the cancer other options may still be available. Determining the cause takes time and so we wait.</p>
<p>Sam rested most of the the morning. In the afternoon he had enough energy to play a video game with me. This is something he had been longing to do for several days but had not had the energy for. We had a great time together saving humanity from massive bugs that threatened future civilization. It was so good to see him be himself for a couple hours.</p>
<p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent talking with doctors, resting, visiting with Gram and Papa C. As a family, the three of us, we have been watching a survival reality show: “Alone”. The experiences of the show’s participants resonate with Sam.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sam rests for the morning each day and as we watch him it seems he is more tired and harder to rouse. Yet we remain in a holding pattern – results are still pending from BC Cancer regarding the abnormal cells found in pleural-fluid. Antibiotics are still running.</p>
<p>Mid-afternoon we had an encouraging interaction as Dr.&nbsp;Jacob came by to check in on Sam. He has a way about him that brings reassurance that Sam is in good hands. We all played a game of Kingdomino – it was great to see strategy-Sam show up. There was definitely nothing wrong with his thinking … once he got thinking.</p>
<p>The afternoon and evening were filled with family including Gram and Papa C, Nana, and Uncle Kevin and Aunt Shannon. Visits are generally quiet as Sam needs to rest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is Wednesday morning as I write this. Sam has been resting all morning with a simple excursion to the x-ray department. The pleural effusion remains and appears to be slightly worse.</p>
<p>A precious moment from this morning was when both Tina and I simply sat with Sam who was resting. One of us on each side of his hospital bed. Each of us holding one of his hands. Oh how I wish I could make these moments last.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="direct">Direct</h3>
<p>The cancer has grown and it has a choke hold on Sam… literally. It is starting to compress major arteries. It is compressing the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) narrowing the bloodflow into his heart. It is starting to compress the major bronchus to his left lung. All this means that bloodflow and airflow, while believed to be currently adequate, are both being reduced. Further reduction will continue as the cancer grows. It is unknown if current treatment can slow the cancer</p>
</section>
<section id="indirect" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indirect">Indirect</h3>
<p>It is likely that the cancer is causing the fluid to build up in Sam’s pleural space. The mechanism causing this is not well understood other than cancer is known to cause it. The team is considering options to control/reduce the fluid buildup.</p>

<!-- 
Since last post: 

S14 Out to Whiterock 
    - New bible for Sam at Indigo books 
    - Cafe Honolulu 
    - Frickers for football NCAA and UFC 
    - Sam and I returned to RMH while Tina stayed with her mom
D15 Sam and I chill at RMH 
    Tina goes with the family to church in Chilliwack -- incident with KF as he neglected her
    Sam and I drive to Whiterock to get Tina.  
M16 Sam and I play Helldivers together -- He had great energy that morning 
    Clinic -- seemed straight forward.  We do flag low energy... this is explained by activity over the weekend but some concern that something else is going on
    Plans with mom and Dad to have them visit. 
    Sam has little energy in the afternoon 
T17 Sam is tired in the morning but rallies by 11 
    Visit with Tios Dave and Ruth
    Sam has a bleeding hemorrhoid -- took some time to manage.  Arrived at ER at 2:30: bloodwork looked okay but numbers are trending down. X-ray suggested a left sided pleural effusion. 
    Back to RMH by 7:30 
    Brief connection with Janelle and Nova. Call with Mom
    Sam is sad a couple times through the evening -- most likely treatment will be delayed.
W18 - Clinic first thing including a CT scan -- to provide detail of the pleural effusion, regular bloodwork. Possible surgery to 
      manage the fluid on the lung.  We review the x-ray suggests near ~50% reduction of fluid.
    - Tina and I had wanted a CT -- 
    - Surgery will not be able to happen -- go get away for lunch and come back at 3:30.  
      Family lunch at Granville Island -- despite reduced breathing capacity Sam walks around the 
      market 
    - Back to clinic at for 3:pm to receive results of the CT 
      - The cancer has grown.  Although not causing issues yet, there CT shows that the disease is
        putting pressure on Sam's pulmonary artery -- causing some minor compression.  
      - Nivo will not be given -- evidence suggests this medication is causing more harm then good.  
        Treatment will need to pivot -- next steps will be determined in the days ahead.  
        It is not known if anything will work
    - walk back -- God's got me -- Yes, God has you!  
    - Sam's choice -- the plan go back to the room and break down.  Rather he decides to watch an episode from the Chosen (S1E3) the epidode where Jesus befriends the little children.  Following this his response to everthing in the day is to believe in faith that this all means "Victory".
    - Gram and Papa C. arrive and sit with Sam.  Dave and Rhoda visit 
R19 - I often go for walks in the morning before my family wakes up. On this walk I wept.  The tears 
      flowed freely as I wrestled with developments from the day before.  
    - Jacob and Molly meet us at clinic -- JR has a plan.  He is clear that he does not know if it will work, but he will try. 
    - Sam receives platelets to ensure he does not bleed during surgery
    - Janelle and Nova play games with us. 
    - Sam has surgery -- Molly comes to be his "comfort-nurse"
    - Dr. Hernandez reports the surgery went well. 
    - RMH -- G&P C are with Sam and I. 
    - Coffee out with Aaron.  Tina connects with the prayer meeting. Rose and Nael provide support

<p>These last number of days have been intense and terrifying. I have limited capacity to write but I will provide the essentials. As such, many of the details, decision making steps, and personal thoughts/responses, have been left out.</p>
<section id="medical-situation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="medical-situation">Medical situation</h2>
<p>We had hoped that Sam would be able to continue with his immunotherapy with another dose of Nivolumab this past Wednesday. However, this did not and will not happen.</p>
<p>Sam had mild symptoms of larger underlying issues over last weekend. The underlying issues would emerge over the following days.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>
<p>At clinic Sam’s numbers (blood and liver related metrics) were looking fairly ‘ok’ and we returned to the RMH.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the afternoon, Sam had a bleed that took some significant time to stop. This, coupled with his increased fatigue and pains, gave us clarity that we should take Sam to the hospital to be looked at. The three of us spent the rest of the day in the ER while various tests were being conducted and various doctors were consulted.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>An x-ray taken during the ER visit highlighted that Sam had a left side <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/pleural-effusion">pleural effusion</a> (fluid around the left lung). Given that RMH was so close to the hospital, and the situation was not immediately urgent, and that we had a clinic visit already planned for the morning, we returned back to the RMH for the night.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once at clinic, Sam was sent down for a CT scan to confirm the extent of the fluid on his lung to provide the <em>Interventional Radiology</em> (surgery team) the information that they would need to drain it. We took a couple hours off before returning to clinic and hearing the results of the scan and next steps.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-important callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Scan results – major pivot
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The cancer had distinct measurable growth since the prior scan on Sept.&nbsp;2.</p></li>
<li><p>This new and unanticipated evidence told us that immunotherapy and the use of Nivolumab were not effective at controlling Sam’s cancerous disease.</p></li>
<li><p>Surgery to drain the effusion was scheduled for the following day.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Thursday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Back to clinic again. Sam’s doctor has a plan for managing Sam’s cancer. It was a relief to know there would be a plan – though specifics would not be communicated until Friday. The doctor was also clear – it is not known if this new plan/treatment will work.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>From clinic we went to <em>surgical procedures</em> where Sam had his left lung drained of fluid. This was without sedation – local aesthetic only. The team took one litre of fluid off of Sam’s lung.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Friday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Again in clinic. We reviewed the plan for the management of Sam’s cancer – a return to chemotherapy. He will be offered similar drugs as he was treated with originally. However this treatment differs from the original as the drugs will be oral – this will not hit him as hard as previous chemotherapies. The intent of keeping this new mode of therapy with generally light impact is two-fold:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<ol type="1">
<li>To protect his already compromised immune system</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>To allow the medical team to more readily switch/adapt treatments as they monitor him.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This became one our longest clinic visits. Sam had low phosphate levels and required an IV infusion to boost him back up. The IV infusion took ~7 hours and it was not started until almost 3:pm. We spent the evening on the ward as we were there well past clinic hours.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="how-are-we" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-are-we">How are we?</h2>
<p>Exhausted, scared. To be honest, I cry a lot. Tears will spontaneously hit me and they flow freely when they do. When the emotion comes it almost knocks me over. Generally, I am not able to leave Sam alone for more than 10 minutes at time without my anxiety nagging me to get back to him.</p>
<p>Sam remains courageous. He has moments of sharing fears and these have transformed to precious times of the three of us sharing together. He is tired of being tired. He is looking forward to feeling better and wants to do so many things.</p>

<p>We have had moments of relief, of joy, and hope. These have been varied:</p>

<!-- 
Since last post: 

W04 Long clinic day (Mahah is Sam's nurse today)
    - Bloodwork 
    - Christina played Mario Kart with Sam.  I think he enjoyed teaching as much as playing
    - Jacob confirms the plan
    - Nivo started
  - Sam visits Oakland and encourages him -- Oakland has a BMT scheduled.
  - Afternoon nap 
  - Franny, River and Emory arrive 
  - WhiteSpot in Kits as a family
R05 A rest day 
    - Nivo seems to be hitting Sam hard.  ... or is it the disease? 
      - Sam is sweaty and achy
      - Tina and I are independently terrified. 
      - I almost broke standing in line for dinner.  All these families they are all going 
        through trauma but they still have their children.  How long will I have my boy?
        Hope seemed lost. 
    - I ran our to Burnaby to get the next refill of Rux.
    - During that time Tina and Sam played a video game! Sam had patience to teach Tina and she did it!
    - Out to Breka. Sam's initiative -- despite how he is feeling.
    - Dave and Rhoda came and visited.  Sam clicks with them so easily.
      - pokemon cards
      - sharing other hobbies (Dave had done them all.)
    - Night: extra itchy (hydroxyzine), ativan for something ..., breakthrough needed for referred pain in back -- disease,
      another effusion -- Sam was no long comfortable to lay on his back.
F06 - slow morning 
    - Clinic and echocardiogram -- no concerns
    - Cal visits -- but Sam is too tired to visit 
S07 - morning ride -- flat tire in Richmond -- Skytrain back
    - slow morning 
    - I am concerned with Sam's lack of activity -- leads to conflict. I think that Sam may also be spending more energy on pain management limiting his ability to live.
    - Frickers and Nana visit.  Fs take Tina out for dinner
    - Sam visits with Nana and does make it down to visit for a 1/2 hour
D08 - Bike ride 
    - Sam chenge meds to 100 / 90 under suspicion that E was being spent on pain management -- seemed to work
    - Sam showers 
    - quiet morning
    - Abbotsford Spaghetti Factory with Cedars grade 11 -- Sam rides bus into Van (6:30 - 9:30).  Before the class arrived we loaded Sam with his afternoon prednisone and a small breakthrough morphine.
M09 - SAM NOTES: He has been sweating everyday/night (not every hour)
    - Clinic 
    - YWAM -- walk Gastown to Abbot st. and back to Victory Park, then to Library.  Sam did amazing
    - Watching shows -- Alone (3 of us), Young Sheldon (Sam and I)
T10 - Quiet day -- allowing Sam to rest 
    - by ~4:30 Sam was ready to engage with class 
    - 5:30 Dinner on Commercial Drive (Jamacan)
    - Church on Frances -- YWAM lead students through pornography and sex trade exploitation.  Boys talk together for 2 hours. 
W11 - Clinic in the am.  This was quite straight forward.  Though Sam loved connectnig 
    -

<p>It has been a good week. Sam’s classmates from Cedars Christian School were here and Sam was able to join them a number of times. Time with his friends was such an encouragement to Sam – and to Tina and me.</p>
<section id="times-with-classmates" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="times-with-classmates">Times with classmates!</h3>
<p>This past Sunday evening the <a href="https://cedars.bc.ca">Cedars</a> Grade 11’s rolled into Abbotsford. We were able to join them there – sharing a meal at the Old Spaghetti Factory. After dinner Sam hopped on the bus and experienced a glimpse of the fun had in transit. In Vancouver, near Commercial and Hastings, the crew moved into a local church that would be their home away from home. Sam had a great visit that evening before the three of us returned to RMH.</p>
<p>I am so thankful to Cedars and the hosting YWAM team as they always welcomed Sam and were able to allow Sam to join in as he had energy.</p>
<p>I am incredibly impressed with <a href="https://www.ywamvancouver.org/mission-adventures">YWAM’s Mission Adventures</a> program – it is really well designed, and their staff did an excellent job of leading the students through all the activities. I am also incredibly impressed with the Cedars team (staff, parent chaperones, and all the students!). They all served, and engaged one another and all the ideas presented to them really well – through some very full days and intense topics.</p>

<p>Students were split into small groups (3-4) to experience two sides of Vancouver. The east is in the throes of poverty, addiction, and common mental health issues. In stark contrast, mere blocks to the west, the business district is characterized by affluent wealth seemingly ignorant to the challenges in the east.</p>
<p><em>Sam was able to join this day for a couple of hours. He spent over an hour walking – more than he has done in long-long time. He loved sharing this time with classmates, interactions with the people, though this large energy output had consequences. Days later Sam is still trying to restore his energy reserves.</em></p>

<p>Students served at a number of different ministries assisting the east-side community during the day. In the evening YWAM led the students through a seminar presenting the issues of pornography, sex trafficking, and highlighting the links to violence against women – intense yet important topics. The reflective work for these topics were set into the context of a prayer vigil.</p>
<p><em>Sam was able to rally energy to join the students for their evening meal (Jamaican) followed by the evening session back at the church. It was a privilege to see the students continue to work through the material after the session. They got it. They wrestled with it. They cared.</em></p>

<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Students experienced other cultures through their religions touring a Mosque, Buddist, and Sikh temples.</p>
<p><em>Sam had clinic that morning and was still recovering from Monday’s walk, so he was not able to attend the temple tours. Later in the day, following a solid nap, Sam had enough energy to connect with his class once again. First, there was dinner out (Indian), then it was back to the church for a debrief session.</em></p>
<p>It was during this debrief session that Sam’s classmates pressed in around him, and took time to pray for him. … It was simply beautiful to experience the love his friends poured out to him.</p>
<p>To end the evening the whole group walked to get ice cream – gelato. Thirty kids-in-a-candy-store (including adults) as we tried to decide what 2 of 238 flavours to choose from!</p>

<p>Love extended to our family was not limited to the Cedars group. Since our last post Dave and Rhoda, Nana, the Frickers, and Uncle Cal have all been able stop in.</p>
<p>Sam has also had on his heart to extend care to another young man who is currently at BCCH<sup>1</sup> and is expected to undergo a BMT in the weeks ahead. Sam has initiated stopping by to encourage him a number of times in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="medical-status">Medical status</h2>
<p>There has been so much beauty in the interactions that we have had this past week.<br>
These interactions have been full of loving-friendship/care and have not failed to acknowledge that Sam’s journey is so challenging.</p>
<p>The previous week Sam was able to have another dose of Nivolumab (Sept 4) – continuing with his immunotherapy. Given the intensity of the events in August the medical team is keeping a close-eye on Sam. By the end of today Sam will have had four clinic visits and two echocardiograms since the last post. To date the clinic visits have been good/simple and without any drama.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><strong><em>Is the immunotherapy working?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>This is a common question that we receive and it is a very important question.</p>
<p>However, it is not one that I can answer – at least not yet. It is not possible to monitor the development of Sam’s cancer on a daily or even weekly basis. We have to wait 3-4 weeks before we can evaluate if the treatment is working.</p>
<p>To-date, since reaching theoretically therapeutic levels of Nivolumab, Sam has not been able to have uninterrupted treatment without other complications causing delays. One of our current hopes is that we will be able to continue with immunotherapy treatment without interruption, so we can have a proper evaluation if the immunotherapy is working.</p>
<p>So we continue to wait and we continue to do the hard work of hope.</p>

<section id="victories-and-concerns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="victories-and-concerns">Victories and concerns</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have lifted/blessed all three of us.</p></li>
<li><p>The cancer has grown (as of Sept.&nbsp;3 CT scan).</p></li>
<li><p>To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this disease. We need a miracle.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer. He has continued with his immunotherapy – had another dose of Nivolumab (Sept.&nbsp;4). It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further complications that could restrict the use of the drug.</p></li>
<li><p>Waves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.</p></li>
<li><p>Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this journey.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sam’s heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">pericardial effusion</a>. We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well (Aug.&nbsp;23). Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made it through again!</p></li>
<li><p>We are celebrating the success of Sam’s stent surgery (Aug.&nbsp;15, see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">here</a>). The outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein).</p></li>
<li><p>It was amazing to see Sam join the <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the hospital. The <a href="https://rmhbc.ca">Ronald McDonald House (RMH)</a> has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the <a href="https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca">Westwood Church</a> office.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all through this journey.</p></li>
<li><p>We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post: 

POST: focus on the state of the disease?

R29: @RMH. Sam was much more rested and was able to enjoy the day.  Our for ice cream and JJ Bean, Kaboodals
    I have been able to connect with Landon.  Although a good day Sam powered out by mid-afternoon
F30: @RMH.  Good connection with Landon as we discuss our kids.  
    Cardio clinic including echocardiogram 
    Oncology Clinic: met Dr. Marie-Claude from Canuck.  She suggested that Sam's acid reflux was related to the lack of 
    space in his chest. Juliana and Jacob were there
    Sam explained how he was doing.  He did this wearing flicking the ears on his hat from Daniel and Alex -- very funny for all.  Plans: CT scan on Tuesday. Hope to proceed with Nivolumab on Wednesday.
    Back to RMH.  A relaxed day.  Sam had great energy for the am and clinic but ran out of power for the pm.  Lots of tv and some video games in the afternoon. Sam and I watched Alone.  Later evening Sam had more energy. ... I was done by this point and fell to sleep.
    Tina had a hard evening missing connections/ her people.
S31: Hillhouse family visited: David and Sam talking.  Off to Earnest and Carson's Used Books 
    Sam is enjoying the show Alone
    In the night Sam's chest -- specifically upper sternum was hot
D01: St. John's Anglican Church
    Paul's Omlettery
    Townsends visit -- talks and pizza out at Woodfire Pizza (Cal, Tricia, Jane, Chris)
    ... couldn't believe how much Sam was able to handle! 
M02: Sam had a rough night with lots of additional meds.  We didn't sleep much.  
    It seems the activity of the previous days had caught up with him.
    He rallied by ~3 when the Frickers arrived.  We all had a decent visit (kinda flat)
    Sam seemed to present adrenal deficit a couple times -- after more food and predisone `.5 hours early
    he seemed more alert and engaged. 
    Good evening 
    Sam gaming online with friends: Ben and John; Julia ad Hadance  
T03: CT scan in the am -- straight forward
    Out to Breka Cafe
    Sam gaming online with friends 
    @Clinic 
    Camara and Gaia
    Review of weekend with Jacob and Juliana
    *items to discuss (i.e. Dad's paranoid thoughts)*
    -   Pains -- internal ... itchy on the inside 
    -   Sam style.  I'm feeling good so therefore I will do a lot 
    -   Lot's of joint pains 
    -   Two episodes of what appeared to be adrenal fatigue 
    -   One evening of sweats 
    -   Hot in the chest
    Results:
    -   slight increase 7.1 x 8.1 x 7.3 previous (7.8 x 7.8 x 6.7 August 22)
    -   August 14 7.4 x 6.6 by (7.7 x 6.9 previous)
    -   P. effusion remains small
    Next Steps:
    -   Do nothing as it causes high risk
    -   Give it -- what side effects will we have ... 
    -   Fear of an acute event. 
    -   What do you think:
        -   I would risk an acute event that MAY lead to death rather than no action that WILL lead to death. 
            (not stated: But no action is a death sentence ...)
        -   Sam states well similar 
        -   Tina agrees 
    -   ALternate therapies -- why we are doing what we are doing ... 
    -   Sam stop treatments when when it is definitive that the cancer will not win. 


W04
    *QUESTIONS and THOUGHTS*
    -   The cancer is causing new pain ... elevated pain.  
        We need options for managing it.  Morphine is not enough and does not hit is fast enough.  
        Usually come on the evening. 
    -   This cancer seems to grow in fits and start -- surging.  Is this  known pattern 
        or is it unique. Or is this an artefact of mixed methods.


What a conundrum.  Sam is the healthiest he has been in this journey.  He is able to enjoy life.  He has a thirst for life.  In the early mornings he rolls over and says to me that there is so much that he wants to do (still not sure how conscious he was). He also added ... with you dad!

What Sam wants -- to share of the love and hope he has in Jesus. "Pain is temporary -- hope is eternal."

<p>Thank you for your love and prayers. I am sending a message I sent Shan recently (to avoid a lengthy rewrite) It is not necessarily edited and may feel raw?! But you need to have an update about what’s happening. We are still fighting so we praise God for this chance 🙌🙌🙌</p>
<p>We were in clinic until about 5:30pm then had dinner together …. The CT scan showed that the cancer has grown. Thankfully, however, it has not grown so much that our Dr won’t offer treatment. We had a long serious discussion with Dr Jacob about proceeding with more immunotherapy considering the potential (fatal) risks. It was actually an amazing discussion. Sam showed such courage and strength and honesty that Jacob (and our nurse clinician Julianna) were amazed and almost in tears. Sam said that he would rather die quickly trying to fight the cancer than giving up treatment and suffering slowly. Colin and I are also in agreement with this statement. So Sam will have immunotherapy again tomorrow morning (unless there is something really off with the bloodwork) with the understanding that we have to stay very close to the hospital and have frequent monitoring for the next while (week and a half?). We are also going to go up on one of Sam’s pills (trying to reach therapeutic levels of that medicine) (that in theory - only in controlled experiments - may be shown to help fight cancer). So it has been stressful and heavy again but Sam is courageous and we continue to go forward in faith together …. Also believing this continues to be the next reasonable thing to do. Sam continues to choose joy and wants to have an evening of the three of us just being together doing things. We really really value your prayers and presence with us on this journey. It is extremely important to us and we are so grateful for your love and care ❤️</p>

<section id="treatment-review" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-review">Treatment review</h3>
<p>If you have been following Sam’s story you know that in the current chapter of immunotherapy (i.e.&nbsp;post-chemotherapy, post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug Nivolumab has been challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When it was first given at the end of February Sam’s liver became inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it again. During this period the cancer grew.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam restarted Nivolumab in June paired with another drug, Ruxolitinib, to control side effects. Sam’s body tolerated this well but dosing was likely below therapeutic levels. At the beginning of August scans demonstrated that the cancer had continued to grow.</p></li>
<li><p>In the first week of August Sam received a single dose of Nivolumab at what was believed to be a therapeutic level. However, by this time the cancer was having impacts on Sam’s heart. In the weeks following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein returning blood from much of Sam’s upper body to his heart. The second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect. Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these surgeries – his body needed time to heal.</p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday’s scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August, had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with treatment – understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam.</p></li>

<p>This past week Sam was discharged following his surgeries. Sam has enjoyed numerous visits with friends and family.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian, Beth and David were here Saturday</li>
<li>Uncle Cal, Aunt Tricia, and cousins Chris and Jane were here Sunday</li>
<li>Nana Mary, Uncle Kevin, Aunt Shannon, cousins Kelsey and Kaden were here Monday</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam has also enjoyed connecting with friends online through games and social media.</p>
<!-- The only downside to all of this activity is that Sam's greatest
physical pains are likely related to all of his activity -- muscles and
joints have ached in the evenings and sometimes through the night. -->

<ul>
<li><p>The cancer has grown (as of Sept.&nbsp;3 CT scan).</p></li>
<li><p>Sam is looking to fight on despite continued growth of the cancer. He will continue with his immunotherapy – have another dose of Nivolumab. It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further complications that could restrict the use of the drug.</p></li>
<li><p>Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this journey.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam’s heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">pericardial effusion</a>. We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made it through again!</p></li>
<li><p>We are celebrating the success of Sam’s stent surgery (see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">here</a>). The outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)</p></li>
<li><p>To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.</p></li>
<li><p>It was amazing to see Sam join the <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the hospital. The <a href="https://rmhbc.ca">Ronald McDonald House (RMH)</a> has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the <a href="https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca">Westwood Church</a> office.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all through this journey.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post 

F23: Pericardiocentisis 
S24: Most of the day in the ICU.  Everything was calm.  Mostly just waiting.  By the end of that evening we had 
    some concerns regarding how much fluid Sam was retaining.  Nurses Jade (in ICU), and Laura on T8.  Nigel at night.
D26: Dr. Eva - cardiologist visited.  Again told of how well Sam had done in surgery. How beautiful it had been 
    to see his heart re-inflate as the pressure came off. Dr. Cathy, Oncologist on call checked on Sam and in discussion with Tina got some lasix going.  Sam had a rough day.  Frickers tried to visit but he was only willing to see Uncle Kev. Finally, at ~6:00 he was willing to take additional pain meds.  This helped for a bit.  Had to push a little harder for additional meds and a Dr. order to increase pain meds to stay ahead of the pain.  Starting overnight Sam'is now at 90/90 m-eslon plus morphine 5mg Q2 (+15mg every 12)... This amount seems to be effective. Pam was on during the day.  Nigel again at night.
M25: Echo in morning and afternoon.  Cardiology Docs want to leave drain in for the weekend.
    Afternoon meeting with Dr. Jacob.  Cytology is not back.  Lasix through to reduce fluid
    Pam during the day, Maddie at night.
T26: Echo at 8:00am.  Dr. Steven from cardiology, assisted by his fellow, pulled Sam's drain at ~11:00am
    Dr. Peggy following procedure.  Review of meds.  Keep Sam for observation overnight. More lasix to finalize drying him out. 
    Rachelle in the day. Lauren in the night

August 29 Update
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Sam was discharged on yesterday. We are back at the RMH where all three of us are catching up on some much needed rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am writing this morning from the hospital. Much of the intensity of <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-23_highs-lows-surgery.html">last week</a> continued into this week – until yesterday. Yesterday, Sam was able to be disconnected from all the various lines used during this latest hospital stay.</p>
<p>This morning, my heart was filled with joy. It was such a simple thing: Sam got up walked to the bathroom and went back to bed falling back into a restful sleep. These simple actions were beautiful: they were in contrast to how the previous days had been; and they represented freedom and health for my boy.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>It is hard to believe that it is only day five since Sam had his latest surgery. Time has moved very slowly as Sam has had to endure new pains, discomforts, and continuous testing.</p>
<p>I am so glad that Sam had the surgery to remove the excess fluid from around his heart (<a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/tests-treatments-medications/medical-tests/pericardial-drainage">pericardiocentesis</a>). Once again the amazing staff at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Children’s Hospital</a> have saved Sam’s life and we cannot thank them enough.</p>
<p>What is not advertised with surgery is that recovery can take time – especially if there are any complications. The first night went well, but I think I will attribute that to the drugs that Sam was on.</p>
<p>By Saturday evening Sam was feeling gross/very uncomfortable. He has tolerated so much during this journey but he had a hard time with this procedure. The worst of it was that he had a wire tube in his chest and that the tube was sitting up against his heart. The tube was used to continue to drain additional fluid in effort to keep the <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0" class="lightbox">pericardial effusion</a> from returning. To complicate his medical picture following the surgery his fluid balance … went off.</p>
<p>This meant that he was swollen and puffy (e.g.&nbsp;swollen ankles and elbows). This was unexpected. Why this happened did not matter as much as the management of the issue – the team again did a great job of bringing his fluid balance back to normal (using IV medications).</p>

Parent advocacy
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is very important to advocate for your child! The medical teams works hard trying to solve issues that they are seeing. As parents we see the big picture. We know what is normal for Sam and when things are not normal.</p>
<p>In particular, during this past week when it was Tina that drew attention to various symptoms that Sam was facing and requested appropriate intervention (i.e.&nbsp;suggesting the echocardiogram that identified the fluid buildup, and needed fluid management post surgery). Tina is awesome!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each day following the surgery Sam would have one and sometimes two echocardiograms (a specialized ultrasound of the heart) to monitor how the fluid around his heart was resolving.</p>
<section id="freedom" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freedom">Freedom</h3>
<p>Yesterday, metrics of healing were strong enough that Sam could be disconnected<sup>1</sup>. The drainage wire was pulled from his chest the hole was lightly bandaged. The wire was about 5 inches long with at least 1.5 inches were set against the side of his heart – no wonder Sam had been in such discomfort.</p>
<p>In addition, by the end of the day his fluid balance was looking much improved and he able to be disconnected from the IV pole overnight.</p>

<p>Our families have been here to support us. The Fricker family was here on Sunday. Nana has been staying at the RMH while Tina and I have been staying in-hospital with Sam. Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth were able to see Sam yesterday, and Uncle Tom along with Daniel and Alex have been able to have a couple visits.</p>
<!-- New friends Jenn an Eamonn brought RMH dinners to us. -->
<p>We have received numerous messages from friends letting us know that they continue to care for us. Thank you all for your continued support. We can’t imagine doing this without it.</p>

<p>It is not clear what all of our next steps are. The past couple of weeks have focused on very acute issues (i.e.&nbsp;stent surgery and pericardial fluid drainage). Though the cancer is likely involved in both of these it was not the focus of treatment.</p>
<p>In the days ahead I expect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>That Sam will be discharged and able to return to the Ronald McDonald House and that we will need to stay close to the hospital.</p></li>
<li><p>We will have clinic visits to monitor Sam’s post surgery progress.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post 
15: note: Nana Mary stayed the night at RMH while Sam and I were at hospital 
16: Friday -- left the hospital.  Cal, Chris, Jane were here.  
17: Sat -- a quiet day at the RMH
18: Sun: Driven Project 
19: Mon: Clinic: liver numbers spiked.  Strategy Games and Hobbies -- Tau empire for Sam    
20: Tues: Clinic again: liver numbers had levelled off but still too high for Nivo.
    That evening we went to the Frickers.  In particular Sam was feeling pretty good
    and was able to engage with family. 
    Sam and I returned to RMH.  Had a nice evening getting to bed just after mid-night. 
    Through the night Sam's pain and nausea were high and difficult to manage 
    Together we decided to go to clinic first thing in the morning.

    A precious conversation with Sam.  First at the Frickers (when he had been resting downstairs), and then on the drive back to RMH. Sam admitted his fears that current pains could be related to the progression of the cancer. It was so good / important to have an honest talk.  I discussed with him that this was a logical possibility and that I shared these fears.  I thanked him for sharing.  Despite this, and given that we have no control, we chose not to be anxious about it, to choose courage.  To choose hope.  To trust that no matter what God has him -- though I know that Sam trusts God better than I do right now.  

*pain had been challenging most evening starting Sunday evening -- initially attributed to higher 
output associated with the Driven Project Activities. Pain management was dominantly use of break-thru
morphine. We were also PEG'ing twice daily to manage constipation but we had not been too concerned as Sam was able to pass small amounts*

21: Wed:  To clinic 
    The team jump into action seeing Sam's pain and nausea.  Resting heart rate of 130
    following immediate interventions of IV ondansetron and some other med reduce reflux pain HR settled to 120.
    Numerous tests.  The most telling of which was the echocardiogram which showed a 
    significant pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart).  Cardiology team were a little 
    stunned to find Sam still walking and talking. Plans are in place to re-evaluate and possibly 
    undergo a procedure to remove the excess fluid from around his heart -- 
    Pico S. was given to address the secondary issue of constipation. 
    Onto the ward for observation overnight. 
    Sam was feeling better through the night.  Resting-HR had reduced further to 90

    In the evening Dave and Krista came by! 

22: Thur:  Sam had a good night.  Resting HR trending to normal now at 85 -- though 
    still some chest pain. 
    Cardiac team in for a clinical assessment
    Tests are completed: Echocardiogram, ECG, CT scan (stent placement)
    *Procedure or wait it out...?*

</div>
<p>This past week started strong. Since my last post Sam was discharged following his successful <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">stent surgery</a> (Friday Aug. 16). We were not sure what to expect following surgery and Sam did struggle with various pains and lethargy. Despite this, through the week we had good visits with family and some big and small adventures. Saturday (17<sup>th</sup>), Cal, Chris, and Jane were here to visit with Tina and I (Sam was not yet up for visitors). Sunday, Sam had a huge day taking part in the <a href="https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/">Driven Project</a>. Monday was clinic – news was not great (see below) but afterwards we had an afternoon out exploring new games and hobbies at a couple local shops – it felt almost normal.</p>
<p>By Tuesday Sam was feeling more energetic and we got away from the RMH to visit family in Whiterock. In his good moments (when not resting away from the family), it was great to see Sam join in on sharing stories, laughing, and generally sitting freely with his cousins, Aunt, Uncle, and Nana. That evening Sam and I returned to the RMH leaving Tina to enjoy more time with her family.</p>
</section>
<section id="lows" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lows">Lows</h2>
<p>Ack, what a roller coaster this week. Backing up, Monday in clinic Sam’s liver numbers showed a sudden spike upwards. This was confirmed again on Tuesday. Sam had also started battling elevated pains starting back on Sunday evening, making sleep difficult. It was Tuesday night that I was no longer able to keep Sam’s pain under control this was also coupled with nausea. We went to clinic first thing Wednesday morning and the medical team jumped into high gear, taking bloodwork, and setting up various tests (Tina joined us mid-morning). By the end of the day it was confirmed that Sam had fluid pressing on his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">Pericardial Effusion</a>. By that point in the day Sam’s pain and nausea were under control (IV meds were far more effective than what I had available), and it was determined to admit Sam to hospital and reevaluate in the morning.</p>
<!-- That evening Sam's
prayer was that his heart rate would decrease enough that physical
draining for the fluid would not be necessary. -->
<p>Thursday morning things were looking great! Sam’s heart rate continued to trend downward towards normal levels. It seemed surgical intervention would not be needed and we would spend a further 24-hours in hospital for observation. During this evening, it was a great comfort to have Dave and Krista C. visit.</p>
<p>So many parts of this journey have involved swings. Friday morning we returned to chaos and uncertainty. Sam’s heart rate had been trending towards normal most of the night but sometime in the early morning it started building again - returning to significantly elevated levels.</p>

<section id="surgery-intensive-care" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surgery-intensive-care">Surgery &amp; Intensive Care</h2>
<p>As I finish writing this post the three of us are in the intensive care. The day has been very intense but we are now in a good place. Mid-afternoon, the medical team decided that it would be safest for Sam to go forward with a surgery to remove the fluid from his around his heart. By 6:00pm he was in the OR where the doctors pierced through Sam’s upper abdomen and then through the pericardial sac to install a temporary drain. The surgery went as planned without any complications – a litre of excess fluid was drained from around Sam’s heart. It was good to have Uncle Cal with us in the anxious waiting.</p>
<p>Sam is a champion. He did the whole surgery under light anaesthetic – meaning he was awake and aware of what was was happening. Apparently he chatted with one of the doctors through the whole procedure reflecting on how great his time at Ness Lake Bible Camp had been.</p>
<p>He is now in the ICU for observation. He is happy, his vitals are much improved, and he is looking forward to playing games with us and his nurse this evening.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s surgery went better than we had hoped!</p>
<p>The original plan was to install one or two stents to maintain the function of Sam’s limited but existing blood-flow (i.e.&nbsp;reinforce one of his small collateral veins). However, the surgeons<sup>1</sup> presented a new plan. The new ‘Plan A’ would be to reestablish flow through the brachiocephalic vein ! They were hopeful they could reopen the left side. They would fall back to ‘Plan B’ as described in my <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-13_threat-response.html">previous post</a> if they were not able to do so.</p>
<p>Plan A was a success! It took significantly longer than planned but 3.5 hours later the doctors came and talked with us. They were obviously pleased that they were able to do this. Tina and I are are ecstatic! Sam is feeling good! We are currently in the hospital for observation but we expect to be back to the RMH by the end of today.</p>

<p>The left and right bracheocephalic veins were believed to be fully occluded. The right was occluded when we first arrived due to blood clotting associated with the disease. As of last week’s scans the left is also fully blocked.</p>
<p>During yesterday’s surgery the team was able to reestablish flow in the left bracheocephalic and to install a stent there to keep it open. This result gives Sam much more ‘normal’ blood-flow and takes the literal pressure off his collateral vascular network.</p>
<p>In addition, measurements during surgery indicated that the Superior vena cava (SVC) is functioning normally.</p>

<p>Last week Sam’s cancer journey reached a higher level of intensity. This has been a hard journey and now it is downright scary. Threats to Sam’s life are incredibly intense. First, there is the immediate threat-to-life as the cancer has caused significant damage to Sam’s vascular system and now threatens the heart itself. Second, despite the valiant effort of our medical team and Sam’s incredible courage to both understand and take on the treatments, the cancer itself continues to grow (see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-07_scan-results.html">previous post</a>). Medically speaking our options are limited – we need a miracle.</p>
<p>Despite the intensity of the current medical situation in many ways Sam appears to be healthier than he has been since before this disease began.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maintaining-blood-flow">Maintaining blood-flow</h3>
<p>The cancer directly or indirectly has blocked/occluded some of Sam’s major blood vessels<sup>1</sup>. As a result, blood from his head and upper body is being re-routed through an extensive network of small collateral vessels that Sam’s body has developed in compensation.</p>
<p>This past week we met with the intervention radiology surgical team. They have made plans to try to keep Sam’s remaining blood-flow pathways open.</p>
<p>On Thursday August 15 Sam is scheduled to have surgery during which stents will be inserted to maintain existing blood-flow to his heart. One will be placed in a small collateral vein that is returning the bulk of Sam’s upper body blood volume. A second stent will be used to keep the Superior vena cava open.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-scare-er-visit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-scare-er-visit">Additional scare – ER visit</h3>
<p>Given everything that was revealed in the last scan our vigilance has been increased (can it go any higher?). On Sunday evening Sam started to have new/novel pains in his chest – at his heart - and strange pulsing sensations in his neck. So we went into the ER.By the time we arrived and settled in, Sam’s vitals were great. As nothing requiring immediate intervention could be determined, and given that we had a visit planned with Sam’s medical team the next day, we returned to RMH.</p>
</section>
<section id="disease-control" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disease-control">Disease control</h3>
<p>It is unknown if this cancer can be controlled but that does not mean we will stop trying. In response to the latest scans we will push on and push harder. Greater risks must be taken. Treatments must be accelerated.</p>
<p>The original plan was to attempt an increase in Sam’s Nivolumab by doubling the dose. Given the latest results we have chosen to push harder. Wednesday the dose was quadrupled in an effort to find an effective dose – though it will take a few weeks to know if it is having the desired effect.</p>
<p>In addition, Sam is back on high-dose steroids (prednisone). One of the primary reasons to use this drug is to quickly reduce inflammation in the body. Sam has also used it in the past to protect his liver which the Nivolumab can harm. Within 24 hours of starting the drug it was possible to visibly see positive impacts.</p>

<p>This past week it was amazing to have the in-person support of some friends and family from Prince George. We had great visits and times that simply felt normal.</p>
<p>Joel, Joanna, and Chase were here for Friday evening and Saturday. We shared meals, went to a movie (Inside Out 2 – it is great!), made an ice cream run, Chase and Sam threw a football around, and played some video games together.</p>
<p>Sunday and Monday my parents came to spend time with us. The effects of the Nivolumab started to set in on Sunday – causing fatigue. However, that did not stop us from spending time and sharing meals together. Sam loved having his grandparents here. Sam seems to be loving his ice cream these days (could be the prednisone) so to wrap up our time together we celebrated with an ice cream cake that Sam requested from DQ.</p>

--->
<p>This past weekend was filled with the love of family and friends but it carried an underlying inescapable anxiety as we waited for scan results. Yesterday, the fears we battled through the weekend were realized – the cancer has grown. Today Sam received an elevated dose of Nivolumab in an effort to get the cancer under control and again we wait, hope, and pray that one of these treatments will finally work.</p>
<section id="an-anxious-weekend" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-anxious-weekend">An anxious weekend</h2>
<p>Last Friday was filled with numerous appointments the most important being a PET scan to determine the current extent of Sam’s cancer. However, it is a rare day that we get the results on the same day – so we had to wait-out this past long/holiday weekend before getting the results.</p>
<p>In addition, given that Sam has been on morphine for such a long time, on Saturday we attempted a plan (suggested by our doctors) to switch him over to methadone (i.e.&nbsp;start replacing morphine with methadone). I do not fully understand why it did not work but by mid-day-Saturday Sam was writhing in pain. It would take another 36 hours before he would start feeling himself again. During this time we were able be with with Nana and the Fricker family (Saturday and Sunday). We would have loved for Sam to take part more with the family but the medication switch had taken him down – he was able to see everyone but he had very limited capacity to be with the family.</p>
<p>By Monday Sam was feeling better, having returned to his regular drug regime. Mid-day we had a nice visit/lunch with friends, Donna and Ciaro, whom we had met through RMH. In the evening we saw the Townsends. It was great to see Sam feeling better and he was even able to enjoy a game with his cousins. We were back at the RMH for the night as we had clinic the next morning.</p>
</section>
<section id="scan-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scan-results">Scan results</h2>
<p>It had been a long wait through the weekend to finally get to clinic yesterday and hear the results of last week’s scans. As always our medical team was amazing, especially given the hard task before them. The results are not what any of us wanted. The cancer had grown again. In retrospect, now that we have enough scans of the same type (i.e.&nbsp;not mixing results from different types of scans), it seems that the cancer has grown fairly consistently and none of the medicinal treatments have had measurable impacts at slowing the disease. Additional concerns were also raised as this disease is having further impacts on Sam’s vascular system as it grows into and around some of Sam’s major vessels and heart. The left and right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_vein">brachiocephalic veins</a> are blocked by impacts of the disease (the main veins transporting blood from Sam’s head to his heart). Sam’s body has adapted as he has an extensive network of smaller/collateral vessels that move the blood around this blockage. Flow is also partially restricted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava">superior vena cava</a>, the major collection chamber for blood returning to the heart from the upper body – again caused by the cancer.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Today, Sam received a dose of Nivolumab at a rate 4-times what he has received previously. This increased dose was done in effort to find a level that may show some effect. However, in doing so we recognize that this may also cause side effects that we have been hoping to avoid. He will remain in hospital for monitoring overnight and if he remains stable he may be discharged to the RMH over the weekend.</p>
<p>Next week Sam will have another contrast-CT in an attempt to image if any impacts can be measured.</p>
<p>So how are we doing through all of this you ask? It would be a lie to say we are not scared. The disease has been a constant threat and now more than ever. However, there are great moments of joy. It is impossible not to smile when Sam wakes from a nap with a big smile on his face saying “<em>I’m so happy.</em>” He is happy – he knows he is cared for and he knows that he is loved.</p>

<p>I am currently writing in the dark as Sam is having a nap, waiting for his turn in the PET scan machine. I would be lying if I said that all of us are feeling great this morning. The reality is that scan days are always stressful as they mark significant chapters in Sam’s treatment. They mark significant pivot points where treatment plans are adjusted – either to keep going with the treatment regime or change it up. Perhaps today’s scan is all the more stressful as it is to determine if one of our last treatment options (immunotherapy combined with a new medication) is working or not. Additionally, being back in Vancouver and being under the watchful eye of our medical team is in stark contrast to the freedom, fun-living, and joy had with friends this past week.</p>
<section id="an-amazing-week-at-home" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-amazing-week-at-home">An amazing week at home!</h2>
<p>I am still stunned at how good this last week has been! Since my last post:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Saturday</dt>
<dd>
<p>This day was a turning point. Most of this day and all of the days prior that week Sam had been feeling the effects of his immunotherapy drugs – generally wiped-out/lethargic and achy.</p>
<p>In the evening he had a return of energy and the Bandstra, Claus, and Cross families rearranged their plans and came over. We had a great summer evening in the back yard talking and playing games. Sam was especially encouraged receiving the care of friends.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sunday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tina and I made it to church… well we made it in the door and then spent the time connecting with people. Sam slept in that morning but gave me a call asking to come greet people following the service. It was encouraging for all!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the evening, Sam having heard from his friends the night before about how great working at <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> was, he asked to go and visit – which we did. However, Sam wasn’t satisfied with visiting and by the end of the evening he had spent several hours working in the kitchen or wherever else he was able.<br>
<!-- five hours at camp --></p>
</dd>
<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>
<p>We figured that Sam would need a rest day – we were wrong! That afternoon Tina took Sam out to camp again where he worked, visited, and took part in cabin time with the kids!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>That evening some of the church leaders came by to support and pray with us and for Sam – more encouragement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>I spent the morning at work – made it out to the forest. It was great to be there again. Also, to connect with my work-world people!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sam was not going to miss out, and he was out to serve at camp again. Tina had expected to take him home at any point, but he stayed until late in the evening! He even had energy for the evening <em>Safari</em> game where leaders dress up as animals and the campers have to <em>hunt</em> them. He had an amazing time. Though a fall during the game resulted in us putting him in an air-cast. An x-ray, if needed, will be completed while we are here in Vancouver. This leg pain was all worth the experience of joining the team.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a family, we focused on packing up to be ready to head south.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sam was thinking he would have a rest day but having received an invite from camp to join in on activities, he was not going to miss out. That evening Sam, although hobbling with the air-cast, took part in work projects, discussion times, and then the end-of-week <em>button ceremony</em> where Sam was awarded two buttons. The encouragement definitely went both ways: camp leaders were so impressed with Sam, while Sam had his heart-bucket filled to overflowing.<br>
<br>
From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6Wbygpy8NLnhsAvp/">Dave Horton’s post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sam Chisolm earned his summer team shirt and both director pins (which does not happen ever)…</p>
<ul>
<li>for serving others (through some physical pain) before himself</li>
<li>for going from a visitor to “what can I do to help.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Dude helped with dishes, A team, camper supervision and more. We could not find enough for him to do.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tina, Sam, and I have been so encouraged by these days that Sam had in camp. It was amazing to see him rise and have the energy to engage. Amazing to see the joy he had. A huge thank you to all of the Ness Lake Crew – thank you for welcoming Sam onto the team!</p>
<dl>
<dt>Thursday</dt>
<dd>
<p>We got away from Prince George in great time. Had a great visit with family in Langley and then settled into the RMH that evening.</p>

<p>I can understand it if you were feeling like you were missing our on our lives and wondering what is going on – it has been over two weeks since I last wrote.</p>
<p>In that time we were at home, travelled to Vancouver, and returned home again. During our times at home, we had some good visits with a number of our friends here, and I started to feel that I was maybe beginning to recover from burnout. Sam, of course, despite often feeling physically exhausted from it all, continues to be amazing, maintaining his positive attitude throughout this long journey.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>Most recently, last Thursday, July 18, we made a roadtrip down to BC Children’s. We chose to drive as it allows for more flexible timing and gives us some freedom while there. On that Friday, there was a minor question-mark related to some of Sam’s bloodwork and the team chose: to adjust some of Sam’s supporting medications<sup>1</sup>, and to wait out a cold that he had.</p>
<p>Over the weekend we were able to have a visit with the Frickers and Nana including a nice afternoon watching the tide come in at Crescent Beach.</p>
<p>The next Monday Sam’s cold and bloodwork had improved and he was able to receive another dose of Nivolumab. In addition an echocardiogram showed that there were no significant negative impacts on Sam’s heart. Despite not leaving the clinic until 4:30 that afternoon we decided to start our trip home. We made it to Kamloops that night and the rest of the way on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This last trip down marks our shortest visit to BC Children’s Hospital and the Ronald McDonald house. It is our hope that this will become a more normal pattern. Yet it is too soon to discuss patterns or plans for life.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-forward" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>On August 2<sup>nd</sup> Sam is due back in Vancouver. We will spend several days there as he is scheduled for a PET scan, an ultrasound, and another dose of Nivolumab.</p>
<p>In the meantime we have just over a week at home. We are loving it here – however in some ways it is a strange adjustment (including not having Tina’s parents here). Many thanks to whoever mowed our backyard! In this time we will celebrate birthdays, I will get to work for some part days, and we hope to continue reconnecting with our Prince George friends and family.</p>

<p>It has been a week-and-a-half since my last post. Despite some challenges the overall picture is good as Sam’s body has tolerated the new combination of medications. In addition, the MRI scan showed that the cancer has not grown since the previous scan.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="june-29th">June 29<sup>th</sup></h3>
<p>We have had a few challenges since I last wrote – I am glad they are not all focused on Sam.</p>
<p>The last weekend of June was tough. Tina and I celebrated our 28<sup>th</sup> anniversary (love you Tina!) while visiting Nana in White Rock (the Frickers were away). Sam had received his dose of Nivolumab a week earlier and what we now know/remember is that it takes about a week for effects and corresponding pains to set in. One of the hardest things in this whole journey is to watch your child when they are in pain and to not understand what is causing it. Over the next couple days we were able to get his pain under control allowing to feel himself again.</p>
<p>Also that weekend, Nana Mary was having some heart related symptoms that gave us a scare – she seems to be good now.</p>
<p>To celebrate our anniversary, instead of going out for dinner, Tina and I chose to stay in and eat with our beloved Sam and mother Mary. It was a good evening, despite the uncertainty of everything going on.</p>
</section>
<section id="july-6---8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="july-6---8">July 6 - 8</h3>
<p>In addition to waiting for these situations to resolve, one reason that this post is a few days late coming is that this past weekend I was laid flat. A head cold took all my energy for the better part of Saturday through Monday.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="current-medical-situation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-medical-situation">Current medical situation</h2>
<p>Sam’s medical situation over the last couple weeks is generally good news!</p>
<p>First, Sam’s body is tolerating the latest mix of medications – specifically, <a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_monograph.pdf">Nivolumab</a> and <a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Ruxolitinib_monograph.pdf">Ruxolitinib</a>. The initial attempt to use Nivolumab, at the end of Feb., did not go well and resulted in lost time recovering from side effects (primarily liver inflammation). Currently, the combination of these two drugs seems to be working well – specifically, metrics related to Sam’s liver are stable and even in normal ranges.</p>
<p>Sam also had an MRI of his chest last week the results of which were encouraging. Though it is too soon to tell, or to relate the scan to the latest drug regime, the results indicated that the cancerous mass had not grown (in contrast to the previous PET scan). We are once again hopeful that the cancer can be held back/ controlled. The MRI also provided incredible details of Sam’s upper body and the medical team will continue to review this latest set of images to evaluate future treatment options.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-forward" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>It is hard to believe, but a pattern to life may be starting to emerge. We have learned (along with every oncology family we know) that we must be cautious in having plans as anything or everything can change at anytime. However, we are now starting to make plans with our medical team that extend beyond the next clinic visit. Given that Sam is tolerating the medications we are starting to look to the weeks ahead.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sam will need to be in Vancouver every two weeks to receive the dose of Nivolumab.</li>
<li>Coupled with this approximately every four weeks he will have some sort of scan (likely alternating between PET and CT)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam received his latest dose this past Friday and yesterday’s numbers looked good.</p>
<p>Given that there is nothing to do here in Vancouver until July 19, we plan to head for home tomorrow!</p>

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Sam's immunotherapy treatment has been delayed. We hope to see this
    treatment start by the end of this week.
-   GVHD effects have continued since Sam received his BMT. One effect
    of GVHD is that fluid has accumulated around his heart making it
    unsafe with other treatments until that is dealt with.

<p>Following a delay Sam’s treatment is now going forward.</p>
<p>Sam is on a new mix of medications that will hopefully slow the cancer and empower his immune system to attack the cancer. The two main immunotherapy drugs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_monograph.pdf">Nivolumab</a> – is referred to as a check point inhibitor. Essentially, this drug disables a protein that allows the cancer cells to hide from the immune system. The downside is that it intensifies GVHD.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Ruxolitinib_monograph.pdf">Ruxolitinib</a> – is being used to offset the impacts of GVHD. Some research suggests that this medication may also be synergistic with Nivolumab.</li>
</ul>
<p>We continue to be in Vancouver as Sam starts these treatments. We need to be sure that Sam can tolerate this new set of medications so potential adverse side effects are being monitored. The medical team also wants to keep a close eye on the cancer – a new scan of Sam’s chest is scheduled for next week (an MRI).</p>

<p>We had to know if Sam’s new immune system from the BMT would be able to stop the cancer – we now know that it cannot. The results of the June<sup>12th</sup> PET scan simply sucked – the cancer had grown, and likely spread into two lymph nodes close by.</p>
<p>So we pivot and move onto the next plan which will be a combination of different immunotherapy drugs. Past research suggest that these drugs could be effective at 1) interrupting a key metabolic pathway in the cancer cells, and 2) disable some of the cancer’s defenses that allow it to hide from the immune system.</p>
<p>Last Friday we were hoping to see Sam start on this modified immunotherapy drug treatment plan, but it was not safe to do so. Since receiving his BMT<sup>1</sup> Sam has had some level of GVHD<sup>2</sup>. One ongoing effect of GVHD is that fluid has built up around his heart (measured using an echocardiogram). To date this has not impacted his heart function. The challenge and safety concern is that the new immunotherapy treatment will likely intensify GVHD impacts that could put his heart at risk.</p>
<p>So instead of treating the cancer, last week Sam was started on a steroid to reduce GVHD effects. Yesterday, a repeat echocardiogram and blood metrics suggest that this GVHD treatment is working and this should allow Sam to start on the immunetherapy/cancer-treatment later this week.</p>

<p>We have all had our moments this past week. It has been emotionally challenging and at times each of us has had to confront our fears. We have also had beautiful times as we have been able to do that together.</p>
<p>We have received many notes of support and encouragement – thank you!</p>
<p>We have also enjoyed watching the hockey playoffs with family in the area. Uncle Cal also did his faithful visit after teaching in Richmond.</p>

<li><p>We are concerned as cancer treatments have been delayed. The effects of GVHD caused fluid build-up around Sam’s heart making it unsafe to proceed with immunotherapy.<br>
At the same time we are thankful that Sam’s medical team continues to be diligent and thorough to protect him and to bring him to a healthier/safer place before starting this next treatment.</p></li>

<p>Two days ago, Wednesday June 12, Sam had his latest PET scan. Yesterday afternoon the three of us met with Sam’s doctor to review the results.</p>
<p>The results are unfavourable – they are not what we want. Sam is still in the fight and there are still medical options to pursue. So, despite taking a hit, we hold hope and prepare for the next steps.</p>
<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The latest scan showed growth of the central mass in Sam’s chest. The cancer has expanded, it is not by a lot but it is distinct and beyond any possible measurement errors. In addition, two lymph-nodes in close proximity to the cancer show increased activity – we have to assume that the disease is now there as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>The last few weeks have been a test to determine if Sam’s new immune system could battle the cancer on its own. Unfortunately, this test failed. During that time Sam has also had some of his best living. We were able to be home and he was able to enjoy his life, time with friends, and time learning at school.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Sam’s treatment plan will involve the re-introduction of some immune-therapy drugs. Nivomulab is an check-point-inhibitor will be given at a lower dose than previous. Other medications will be introduced in an attempt to reduce the more intense graft-versus-host impacts that Nivomulab has caused in the past.</p>
<p>Sam will also be closely monitored utilizing an alternating schedule of contrast-CT and PET scans.</p>

<p>Today is the day and Sam is ready!</p>
<p>Sam had a couple rough days leading up to today but he is now comfortable, settled into the the isolation room, and ready to take on the BMT. The actual transplant will happen later today and should be rather anti-climatic. The transplant is similar to receiving blood the difference being that the material in the bag will be bone marrow stem cells. These cells will take up residence in Sam’s bone marrow and start generating new blood – transplanted blood providing a new immune system.</p>
<p>Yesterday went well. The greatest challenge was moving Sam across the hall. It sounds simple but I was wiped out by the end of the day. In moving over everything had to be sterilized. Most items were thoroughly wiped, and placed in clean containers. Laundry had to be re-done as I had not washed the clothes to BMT clean standards. The medical team also had a big task taking all of the furniture out of the room, sterilized the room, and then they cleaned and sterilized each piece of furniture before returning it.</p>
<p>Sam’s isolation room is similar to the other rooms here on the ward. It has his medical bed, a recliner chair and a fold down couch/bed for Tina and I. The difference is that there is a small anteroom. This room has two sets of glass sliding doors. One door leads to the ward and the other to Sam’s room. Only one door is allowed to be open at one time to ensure that the air in Sam’s room is clean. In the anteroom we clean any items before they are passed into the room. It also in this room that we put on gowns to cover out ‘dirty’ outside world clothing. It is actually much simpler for Tina and I to leave and enter than I had expected.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s highlights was seeing friends. Sam was able to visit with Ben while Tina and I visited with David and Krista C. – following their visit Sam moved to the isolation room. In the evening Uncle Cal stopped was able to wave at Sam through the window. Senga and Tina were also able visit.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming-today">Upcoming today</h2>
<p>Off course today is <em>the day.</em> Sam will receive his bone marrow transplant. This will be likely be sometime in the afternoon but it completely depends on when the donor material arrives. We have no idea if it is coming from within the city or from across the globe. In a couple years there may be an opportunity to meet the donor. Whoever you are <em>I can not thank you enough</em>!.</p>

<li><p>We have completed a major chapter in Sam’s treatment. With the completion of this last/ sixth round of chemotherapy and targeted radiation.

  <title>Last chemo</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Monday morning, Sam is in a deep and restful sleep. Today is his last day before the BMT, and yesterday was his last dose of chemotherapy. It all goes as planned this will have been his last dose ever, and I look forward to a time when the memories of chemotherapy fade. Chemo sucks.</p>
<p>Yesterday was going really well for Sam. He woke up with a bright attitude and energy to take on the day. He really enjoyed his visit with his friends Chase and Caleb C. Ahh so good to see friends – what a bright highlight to our day! Following this visit Sam had a big nap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sam woke up shortly after shift change in piecing pain – the side effects of chemo had set in while he had slept. When he woke mucositis had had left his mouth as an open wound, raw and full of sores. I am sure as many of you know from your own experiences it is hard to watch your child in pain. It took some time to get new orders but solutions were found. We had to wait an abnormal amount of time for the pain specialist team… we had to wait because they were helping some other poor child with their pain.</p>
<p>Between 10pm and 1am we had some needed victories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sam, knowing that the mucositis will only get worse in the days ahead, requested a NG<sup>1</sup> feeding tube. We all knew this would be needed and this was likely last best chance to install it without much difficulty. Our nursing team was successful at doing this.</p></li>
<li><p>The oncologist on-call was able to find a temporary pain solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The pain specialist team changed his main pain relieve medication and placed it on a constant infusion. Sam will also have a limited amount of addition pain relief available at the push of a button.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A special thanks to our nursing team who advocated for Sam and took on all of the additional task needed to get Sam comfortable. Thank you especially to Ana and Molly.</p>
<section id="upcoming-today" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming-today">Upcoming today</h2>
<p>This morning we will prepare all of our stuff for the transition into the BMT isolation room. It all needs to be cleaned and stored following special protocols. The medical and cleaning teams here at the hospital will ensure that Sam’s room is spotless. We will need to make sure that anything we bring in does not contaminate it.</p>
<p>Sam should also be able to have one last outside visitor before the move into isolation.</p>
<p>We expect the actual move into isolation will be sometime in the mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>It is the middle of the night / early morning, Day minus 2 until Sam’s BMT. Sam is finally asleep. I don’t think he realized the level of pain he was in and it has taken about three hours to get a cap on it. Today will be another big day of immune therapy and chemotherapy drugs.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Friday last day of radiation (day -4)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sam completed his radiation therapy. This third day was much better then the days prior – no pain or nausea. Sam even had a burst of hyper energy in the evening and literally ran around the ward - excited to have completed the radiation phase.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Nana, Kevin, Shannon, and Kaden were able to come by for a visit. Nana is staying with Tina at the RMH for a few days – great to have her support!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Saturday fist day of immune and chemo therapies (day -3)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sam’s immune suppression therapy began. It started with bringing in the big IV tower – it currently has 8 IV pumps with room to expand. Sam will have to push, pull, and drag this thing around for the next month or more. With the IV tower in place the immune therapy began. Numerous drugs were administered through the day. Later in the evening Sam received his chemotherapy drugs. So what’s all this mean for Sam?<br>
<br>
New therapies bring new and weird sensations. All of it causes fatigue. The return to chemotherapy is a hard reminder of how these drugs make his body ache and pain management becomes more challenging. I also recognize that while outside of the hospital we had incredible flexibility in pain management. The medical team at Canuck Place were able to consult with us at any time and had given us a lot of tools to manage pain. Here at the hospital it is more difficult as specific orders need to be written and the nurses are generally restricted to those orders. … changing them in the middle of the night on a long weekend can be done. It just not very easy.</p>

<p>A couple of Sam’s friends are planning to pay a visit before he goes into isolation! It will be so good for Sam to see them. This whole process can be very isolating and it important for him to know that his friends are still there for him.</p>
<p>This Tuesday Sam should receive the transplant! The weeks following will focus on facilitating engraftment and managing his day to day health. None of this will be very easy especially given that he will have no immune defenses for a number of weeks.</p>

Update: Nov.&nbsp;10, 2023
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>By yesterday afternoon Sam was feeling himself again. Nausea and pain were under control and he has is appetite back! As a family we had a good time sharing the notes of encouragement that we have received from the recent post on Facebook.</p>
<p>Today Sam completes the TBI treatments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am writing from BC Children’s Hospital, it is in the morning of Day -5 leading up to Sam’s bone marrow transplant (BMT; transplant day is Nov. 14). Yesterday Sam began his BMT conditioning treatments. This started with two rounds of total body irradiation (TBI) at 8:00am and 2:30pm. Following these treatments Sam was admitted, as planned, to the hospital.</p>
<p>The days leading up to the BMT will be full of various treatments to prepare Sam’s body to receive the donated bone marrow. We had expected this to be hard, but I had not expected it to be immediately hard. This new treatment has hit Sam with a new intensity. He has been nauseous and ill, has had distinct new pains, and slept most of the day and continues to sleep now. Talking with the doctors all of the new symptoms are common to the TBI.</p>
<p>Sam continues to be strong. Halfway through the afternoon treatment he was nauseated, he took a few minutes to puke, then with a let’s-do-this-determination positioned himself to complete the second half of that treatment.</p>
<section id="current-treatments" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-treatments">Current treatments</h2>
<p>The goal of these pre-transplant treatments are two-fold: 1) Make room for the donated material, and 2) Suppress Sam’s existing immune defenses to allow acceptance of the donated material.</p>
<section id="making-room" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-room">Making room</h3>
<p>Between today and tomorrow Sam will receive another four treatments of TBI. Over the weekend he will receive chemotherapy. The intent of these treatments will be permanently remove Sam’s native immune system. More specifically, the blood producing cells in his bone marrow will be destroyed to make room for the donated material. There will be no going back.</p>
</section>
<section id="immune-suppression" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="immune-suppression">Immune suppression</h3>
<p>Also on the weekend Sam will start receiving immune suppression treatments to prepare his body to receive the transplant material. Where the TBI and chemotherapy remove the body’s ability to generate <em>new blood</em> including immune system blood cells, the immune suppression therapy will manage the existing immune defenses. Sam’s existing mature immune defense cells will be suppressed so that they do no attack the donated material – facilitating the acceptance of the donated bone marrow.</p>

<p>It has been half a day since I initially wrote this. This morning’s TBI therapy went much the same as yesterday’s. Since we have been back to the hospital the team here has made extra efforts to manage Sam’s symptoms. We should have a better visit to the BC Cancer clinic this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sam is a courageous champion! He has now endured and completed two types of cancer treatment, and is ready to take-on the upcoming bone marrow transplant (BMT). Over the past six months Sam’s treatments have focused on attacking the cancer cells within his body. He received six rounds of chemical chemotherapy between May and Oct.&nbsp;Over the last two weeks, following the completion of the initial chemotherapy treatment, tactics were changed to use radiation therapy against the largest detectable cancerous mass that remains in the center of his chest. The upcoming BMT will mark a significant change in strategy for removing the cancer. Instead of attacking the cancer directly the BMT will provide a long-term indirect assault on the cancer (long-term being life-long). This process will replace Sam’s immune system – removing his current native immune defenses and replacing them with a donated immune system. Where Sam’s immune system was not effective at detecting and attacking the cancer it is expected that the new immune system will. This process is not easy and Sam may face his greatest challenges to date. However, he is looking forward to completing these next phases.</p>
<p>There are currently 8 days until Sam receives the actual transplant. However, there are numerous steps/procedures to be completed to prepare his body for this process. This Wednesday he starts these steps.</p>

<p>It is amazing to me how a short medical appointment can dominate an entire day. Monday through Friday this past week marked Sam’s second and final week of targeted radiation therapy to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. The actual procedure was usually not more than 15 minutes but it would dominate out entire day. Each day we would get ready, load up and head down to the BC Cancer clinic, a short drive away. Tina and Sam would check in while I attempted to find parking – there were a few days where Sam was done before I was able to park the van. Following treatment we would return to the RMH. Sam has generally felt well though with increasing fatigue. His medical team is happy with his current health: <em>He is an otherwise healthy young man, but with cancer.</em></p>
<p>We may never know the full impact that the radiation will have on the cancer. The radiation therapy can take weeks to show measurable impacts but by that point we will be well into the BMT process. I expect next scans to evaluate the various treatments and the state of the cancer will not be feasible until into the new year.</p>

<p>We were able to visit with and be encouraged by some family and friends this past week. Aunt Tricia put on an amazing meal. Uncle Cal paid a visit. Sam was able to have some time hanging out with cousin Kaden, while Tina and I visited with Kevin, Shannon, and Nana. Yesterday John, Jess, Kate, and John Jr.&nbsp;stopped by for a few hours. Tina was able to have and afternoon away visiting with her cousins in Abbotsford.</p>

<p>This coming week will mark a point-of-no-return as Sam will have intense treatments to condition his body for the BMT – all the gains that have been made in returning Sam to feeling healthy will likely be ripped out from under him. These treatments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total body radiation</li>
<li>BMT Chemotherapy – intense chemo-drug therapy</li>
<li>Immune suppression drugs</li>
<li>The BMT transplant</li>

<p>Following the BMT medical efforts will focus on managing Sam’s day-to-day health and finding the balance of facilitating successful engraftment while suppressing graft-versus-host-disease impacts. To complicate matters symptoms of graft-versus-host-disease are easily confused or even synonymous with the flu, colds, or other infections which he will also be highly susceptible to – the medical team will have to be highly vigilant.</p>

  <title>Targeted Radiation</title>

<p>It is <em>Day -15</em> as we count down the days towards Sam’s bone marrow transplant (BMT).</p>
<section id="this-past-week" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="this-past-week">This past week</h2>
<section id="treatment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
<p>Sam is currently in his targeted radiation phase, which is intended to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. Each day this past week we went to the BC Cancer clinic at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). During each visit the technician would use a mold of Sam to get him into position. The mold extends from below his shoulders up over his head and they use it to literally pin him to the treatment table ensuring that he is in the exact same position each time – thereby ensuring the radiation focuses on the intended area.</p>
<p>Sam is doing well with it all. Sam is now over thirty days away from the previous chemo-drug treatments and his strength is returning. He is a generally healthy young man, but with cancer. This is where we want him to be – as healthy and as strong as possible before starting the BMT.</p>
<p>So far the only side effect from the radiation therapy has been fatigue. It is different than chemo-fatigue which caused him to not have any energy, be nauseated, and caused brain fog. This radiation induced fatigue is the need to sleep, but once awake Sam usually has energy to go for walks and enjoy his life.</p>
</section>
<section id="visitors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visitors">Visitors</h3>
<p>We had a good number of family and friends visiting with us this past week. Not everyone got to see Sam as he is being very cautious about seeing people – he is also training Tina and I to do the same as we all mask up more and more. Visitors included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gram and Papa spent some great time with Sam prior to heading home this past Monday</p></li>
<li><p>Nana, now living in the area, was able to come by for the Thursday afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncle Kevin and cousin Kaden were able to be here for a few hours. I love it when Sam and Kaden have a chance to hang out.</p></li>
<li><p>Friday morning I had a great visit with Aaron W.</p></li>
<li><p>Friday afternoon we spent some good time, Colin with Rob, and Tina with Leanne D. They also delivered some great messages of support from our church family in Prince George – thank you all!</p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday evening we were able to get away from the RMH and spend the evening with family out in Langley – celebrating our nieces birthdays. We are so fortunate to have family close by.</p></li>

<p>Today Sam returns to his targeted radiation therapy. It highly likely that the impacts of this treatment will become more distinct with increasing levels of fatigue and potentially skin and esophagus irritation.</p>
<p>Next week after will be more difficult as Sam will have more intense treatments to condition his body for the BMT – all the gains that have been made in returning Sam to feeling healthy will likely be ripped out from under him. These treatments include:</p>

<hr>
<p>In my last post I tried to keep things to a clinical picture. Here I will attempt to capture a little of what it is to live through this cancer journey and to provide more detail on what the upcoming process may look like.</p>
<p>From the latest results, <a href="../../posts/2309/2023-10-15_Results-round-6.html">last post</a>, It feels like we are walking along a knife’s edge separating life and hope on the one side, from doubt, fear, and death on the other. This is not simply a feeling. This is a reality as the results are not great, though they are good enough to keep going.</p>
<section id="good-results-good-enough-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="good-results-good-enough-results"><del>Good results?</del> Good <em>enough</em> results</h2>
<p>Are the results good? Yes – in that we get to keep going, and that there is hope that the treatment will work. However, there are no assurances, and Sam is not in an ideal state for entering the next phases of treatment.</p>
<p>Sam’s cancer is unique, and our medical team is using their best judgment, but none of them have battled this cancer before. They have found a single reference to it, but that has only provided a little guidance.</p>
<p>The medical team is battling hard for Sam and their strategies to date have initially reduced, and more recently kept the cancer from growing. However, compared with known cancers this cancer has not responded as well as any of us have wanted.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-an-ideal-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="not-an-ideal-plan">Not an ideal plan</h2>
<p>We are moving forward with a bone-marrow-transplant (BMT), but we are not in an ideal situation. Ideally, and for best results, when moving to BMT the medical team would like the cancer to be non-detectable. With Sam, starting from where he was back in April, the cancerous mass has been reduced in size, but a significant mass remains. It is not operable as it is in the lymphatic system; although it can be located, as I understand it, it is too amorphous and intertwined within his healthy tissues and bear vital organs (e.g.&nbsp;heart and lungs).</p>
<section id="challenges-ahead" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-ahead">Challenges ahead</h3>
<p>In the weeks ahead Sam will be facing a number of challenges (see <a href="../../plan.html">The Plan</a>).</p>
<dl>
<dt>Radiation therapy – phase 1: <em>Targeted radiation</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Radiation therapy – phase 2: <em>Total body irradiation (TBI)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Next, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>There is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>BMT Chemotherapy</dt>
<dd>
<p>The previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The transplant/graft</dt>
<dd>
<p>On Nov.&nbsp;14<sup>th</sup> Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Once the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choosing-hope">Choosing hope</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to be consumed by fear – to allow the beast of Despair to have a foothold in our lives. Sure we have our moments of anxiety – but we choose hope. Sam remains a champion. We have also laid out some great ideas for his time in isolation – I hope he will feel well enough to take part in the activities we have planned.</p>
<p>We invite you to choose hope with us. It does make this journey easier knowing that you are there with us in mind and spirit. Please continue in your commitment to care and prayer.</p>

  <title>Round 6 results and next steps</title>
  <dc:creator>Colin C.</dc:creator>
  <link>http://samc-news.netlify.app/posts/2309/2023-10-15_Results-round-6.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>This past Friday Sam had a number of appointments, starting with a PET scan first thing in the morning. A PET scan provides 3-dimensional imagery of where the cancer is in the body, and metrics of how metabolically active the cancer is. We have been anxious for the results of this scan as the data would provide direction for the next steps in Sam’s treatment. At clinic, in the afternoon, the results were back – and confirmed the direction that we are going.</p>
<section id="good-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="good-results">Good results?</h2>
<p>For Tina and I, and likely many of you, we hoped for a miraculously good results – that following these latest two rounds of chemotherapy the cancerous mass would finally collapse and be non-detectable. We do not have that result.</p>
<p>At the end of August, following the completion of round four, the medical team communicated their plans to pivot towards a bone marrow transplant<sup>1</sup>. At that time it seemed evident that the cancer would not fully respond to the planned six rounds of chemotherapy. This is the result we have.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The last two rounds of chemotherapy have held the cancer. The mass is stable – it has not grown and it has not spread anywhere new. … Although the cancer has not had any significant decrease in size, the chemotherapy regime that Sam has been under has been effective at holding the cancer back long enough to prepare the BMT process. We also know that the BMT process is the next best step as the now completed chemotherapy was no longer effective at reducing the disease.</p></li>
<li><p>The result are what the medical team hoped and planned for. Plans were initiated over seven weeks ago to prepare for this outcome. If the cancer had grown or spread our conversations with the medical team could have been very different.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The results are good – as they support <a href="../../plan.html">the plan</a>.<br>
The results are also challenging as a hard road lays ahead.</p>

<li><p>Thankful that the chemotherapy has been effective at initially reducing the cancer and lately keeping the cancer contained (as indicated by the PET scan). Thankful that these results allow us to move forward.</p></li>
<li><p>In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Due to some timing and logistics we have had to change donors. We are thankful for this current donor who will provide a peripheral blood sample and is a good match for Sam.</li>
<li>We are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. <em>Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects long term</em>.</li>
<li>The medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. All the pieces need to fall into place for the best timing possible.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement.</p></li>
<li><p>There is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.</p></li>

<p>Sam has a PET scan first thing this morning. This scan is the best tool for imaging the state of his cancer and how his chemotherapy has progressed. Decisions moving forward will be based on the results of this scan.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all of us, including the medical team, are anxious for the results. Preliminary findings may be available by the end of the day but the full report will not be available until next week.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="giving-thanks">Giving thanks</h2>
<p>It is early morning here at BC Children’s hospital and my family is sleeping peacefully. In-hospital is not where we had hoped to be this Thanks Giving, as family in the area were hoping to host us. It would have been great to share a meal, visit with them, and catch up the additional nephews that had flown in. Despite our current situation we still have so much to be thankful for. Top of my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We are here and we have access to an incredible medical team and facility.</p></li>
<li><p>We are able to walk this journey as a family. Support from work, family and friends, church, and the local community allows us to be here without having to worry about life and responsibilities back home. Thank you!</p></li>
<li><p>The Ronald McDonald House provides us a home away from home.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam has been able to connect with friends – especially in the last couple weeks. They talked or talked while playing online games.</p></li>
<li><p>Visitors: We have family in the area that come by on a regular basis to support us. We have friends that make extra efforts to some and see us.</p></li>

<section id="highlights-from-this-past-week" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="highlights-from-this-past-week">Highlights from this past week</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Baseline tests and clinic days</dt>
<dd>
<p>As we begin to wrap up round 6 and pivot to bone-marrow transplant there are many medical appointments. This week was full with regular clinic visits plus the addition of baseline tests.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Thursday Nana and Kevin visit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kevin and I got away – we roamed around downtown and grabbed dinner. It was great to away from the hospital campus for a few hours.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Nana visited with Sam and Tina at the Ronald McDonald House. Following the loss of Gord, Mary has moved south where she is surrounded by family and can access Sam. She in a suite attached to Kevin and Shannon’s.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Friday’s fever</dt>
<dd>
<p>It was a normal clinic visit on Friday morning. We had gone in expecting to review blood levels and then return to the RMH. However, Sam spiked a fever. In a normal non-cancer scenario any of us would just sleep it off, but Sam’s immune system is compromised. Antibiotics were started, tests and bacterial cultures were ordered, and plans were made to admit Sam to the ward for this past weekend. We are hoping/expecting to be discharged later today to return to the RMH.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Dave and Louise SP, friends of ours working in SE Asia were able to stop by before catching their flight back. Great to catch up with and be encouraged by them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Supercars Saturday</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the other parents at the RMH was able to connect with a group of Supercar owners. We thought we might miss-out but the doctor here gave Sam an afternoon pass to take part. We were able to talk with the owners, look at, sit in, and got for some quick rides in these beautiful cars. Makes included Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and Mercedes. I think whenever I see one of these cars on the road I will always remember the joy on all the families faces and the hospitality of all the owners.</p>

<p>This week is very full includes:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Tuesday: Bone marrow biopsy and Lumbar puncture – to confirm that cancer continues to not be present in Sam’s bones or central nervous system</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday will start with a consult with a radiation oncologist (doctor specializing in the use of radiation therapy to combat cancer). This will be followed by Resporatory function and hearing tests – to establish baseline metrics before the bone marrow transplant</p></li>
<li><p>Friday: PET Scan to determine the current state of Sam’s cancer – though the results will not be available until the following week. \</p>
<p>This will be followed by an ultrasound of Sam’s neck where heavy blood clotting was found associated with the cancer. It is expected that these clots have been reduced.</p></li>

<section id="last-goodbyes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="last-goodbyes">Last goodbyes</h2>
<p>Last week was hard but beautiful.</p>
<p>On Friday Sept.&nbsp;29 at 11:00am Papa Gord (Tina’s Dad) passed on to eternity. He was surrounded by his family: Mary, Cal &amp; Tricia, Shannon &amp; Kevin, and Tina. Sam and I had to stay here at the RMH but we were also able to have final conversations, express our love, and say our goodbyes with Gord (via FaceTime). The other grandchildren were able to say goodbye via facetime as well.</p>
<p>Mary and Gord have given us an incredible legacy of love and commitment. It is and will be hard losing Gord though it was beautiful to share in the love of the family as they were able to spend a number of days with Gord before the end.</p>
<section id="the-week-in-review" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-week-in-review">The week in review</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Tuesday – a whirlwind of day.</dt>
<dd>
<p>It started with a big clinic day including lots of time with Dr. Jacob, the team lead of the BMT team, providing us a review of the process going forward. During this conversation Tina was fielding various communications regarding her dad, that he was in ER in Prince George.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Great news from this day was that there is a bone marrow donor for Sam, and the donor is willing to undergo the bone marrow extraction process. This is great news for Sam’s path of healing.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>By mid-afternoon flights were booked and in the evening Tina’s brother Cal and his wife Tricia picked Tina up to head for the airport where they met Tina’s sister Shannon and her husband Kevin – the five of them travelled to Prince George to see Gord. While they were en route Sam and I had a good FaceTime conversation with Papa Gord.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday – Thursday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Gord, though responsive, was not going to recover. By the end of day on Wed. he was transferred to Hospice. The siblings and Tina’s mom Mary, spent great quality time with Gord – sharing loving memories.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Back at the RMH Sam and I kept going with medications, pain control, and connected with the family in Prince George. Mucositis was really bad these days.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Friday</dt>
<dd>
<p>The family had a few more hours with Gord and at ~11:00am he entered eternity.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Here in Vancouver, Sam and I were in clinic, including meetings with different doctors and a blood transfusion, when we received word about Papa’s passing.</p>
<p>Sam is happy, though with tears, for Papa to be free of his declining body. Sam spoke words of hope to Papa, about seeing him again in heaven and sharing great experiences there (e.g.&nbsp;fishing and golfing together). Gord’s beautiful strong and gentle soul will be missed here.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Saturday – Sunday</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Prince George team made final arrangements for Gord and began their travels back to the lower mainland, bringing Mary with them to stay at Shannon’s home and be near family. Tina got back to us on Sunday afternoon.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Saturday night was a rough one for Sam and I. Sam hit the limit on what I was allowed to give him for pain control. Help was just a phone-call away. The on-call oncologist provided me additional pain control instructions and I was so glad to hear Sam gently snoring by early morning. Plans were also put in place to visit the hospital during the day – Sam got a blood transfusion.</p>
</dd>

</section>
<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<p>This week includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular clinic visits – and likely more blood products</li>
<li>more planning for the BMT</li>
<li>Some medical imaging as the medical teams create a baseline of Sam – essential for determining impacts of the radiation and BMT process.</li>

<li><p>Thankful that Sam has been able to connect with a number of friends from back home via online discussion tools and games.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful that when things do get difficult (e.g.&nbsp;pain management and low blood levels) help is only a phone call away. The medical team here at BC Childrens continue to be amazing.</p></li>
<li><p>Chemotherapy continues to take its toll. His energy levels are lower with each round. As with previous rounds Sam’s blood counts are falling and mucositis has set in. We hope that that these side effects will be less intense and that they can be short lived – that Sam does not have to feel gross.</p></li>

  <title>Completing round six’s treatment phase</title>
  <dc:creator>Colin C.</dc:creator>
  <link>http://samc-news.netlify.app/posts/2309/2023-09-23_r6-treatment.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>It is early Saturday morning, day 5 of Sam’s chemotherapy, Sam and Tina are sleeping. Today is the last chemo-drug delivery day for this sixth round. Today is the last drug delivery day for this current treatment regime. Thanks to our medical team here, by adjusting chemo delivery times a little each day we will get out of the hospital and back to the RMH by mid-afternoon – much better than having to spend another night which is more the standard.</p>
<p>Sam continues to take on this challenge well. He is determined and has made the most of his time here. Specifically, this time, he made choices to simply get out of the hospital room. We spent hours sitting on the terrace/deck and in the family lounge reading and playing cards – I finally beat Sam at crib though I expect this victory will be short lived.</p>
<p>The realities of not going home after this treatment, and of not starting school with his friends, are setting in and it is hard. Sam misses home, his friends, and our life there. This is hard for him.</p>
<p>We also choose hope and courage. There is a plan and the next steps are laid out ahead of us. We can do this.</p>
<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular check-ins at clinic.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuesday we will also meet with the BMT team to review how their planning are going.<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>In the weeks ahead there will be numerous baseline tests before starting radiation and BMT therapies. I have these next steps outlined in <a href="../../plan.html"><em>The Plan</em></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="victories-and-concerns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="victories-and-concerns">Victories and concerns</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Thankful for the care and connections with other families here at the RMH. We are all walking our own journeys with our children in need. Although each story is unique we find solidarity and some levels of comfort and council in the sharing of similar experiences. Over time these families are becoming friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam remains in good spirits about the upcoming process (i.e.&nbsp;bone-marrow-transplant). He knows it will be tough but he also knows that there is hope in completing this plan. It is hard to see him carry all of this. He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Chemotherapy continues to take its toll. His energy levels are lower with each round. The next phase of this round of chemotherapy will see his blood counts fall, an mucositis will likely set in. We hope that that these impacts are not as strong as the last couple times and that Sam does not need to feel as gross.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam will need strength for the BMT journey ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam. We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process. One option is to just receive blood but the better option is to receive marrow. The latter, receiving marrow, is far better for Sam but involves a intense procedure for the donor.</li>
<li>Side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. <em>Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects</em>.</li>
<li>The medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. That all the pieces fall into place for the best timing possible.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for Sam’s school who are looking forward to his return and who are willing to work with us once Sam is able. We are thankful for his classmates who wrote him and sent him gifts.</p></li>
<li><p>There is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.</p></li>

<p>This morning I am writing from the RMH dining hall as my family sleeps upstairs. It is the morning of day 154, and day 1 of round 6 should start later today. This has been a hard and long journey. If all had gone as hoped this would be a day to celebrate as it would be the beginning of the last round of therapy. But things have not gone as planned, and this is just one more step in the effort to rid Sam’s body of cancer.</p>
<section id="courage-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="courage-1">Courage</h2>
<p>I have often told Sam that, though we may not get to choose our circumstances, we can always choose how we respond to them. Will we respond courageously and act rightly/ virtuously? Or do we react in frustration – and further fuel the storm<sup>1</sup>? Sam has been incredibly courageous. Facing this storm, this terrifying storm, and he has chosen courage. Not that he has never felt fear. Rather, courage is not the absence of fear, it is choosing to face it.</p>
</section>
<section id="facing-despair" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facing-despair">Facing Despair</h2>
<p>This past week I was exhausted – mentally and emotionally exhausted, and it was starting to take a toll on me physically. I was not only wrestling with this cancer storm, I wrestled with my worldview at the core of my being; the foundations of how I interpret life have been shaken to the core. I wrestled with God – where is my God who saves. I have faced Despair and I had moments where I felt that beast would take me.</p>
<p>I am no longer there. I have faced the beast Despair. And I now walk with new energy and freedom. It is not by my own power that I have overcome. I am still processing all the layers that have come together to provide this victory<sup>2</sup>. Numerous pieces have come together including snippets of conversations, the example of another family, concepts from a good book, and some additional experiences.</p>
<p>A simplification of some lessons learned:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Cancer is evil.</li>
<li>God is good.</li>
<li>There is hope.</li>
<li>Despite this storm we are able to <em>live the good life</em>.<br>
I am intentionally leaving this undefined for now, and leave it for you to wrestle with.</li>

We had a number of good visits with my parents. This included them visiting us here and us making a couple trips out to their trailer in Ft. Langley to enjoy the last of summer camping. One afternoon while Sam had time with his grandparents Tina and I had some time to roam Ft. Langley together. Another afternoon I took Buddy for a short hike to Tavistock View Point on McMillan Island.

<p>Yesterday, we were in clinic. Sam’s blood levels indicate that he is starting to climb out of the round 5 chemo-valley. He is through the worst of this round.</p>
<section id="this-past-week" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="this-past-week">This past week</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Most of a day at the BC Cancer clinic to begin planning for radiation treatments.</p></li>
<li><p>Clinic visits at BC Children’s including additional blood transfusions to bolster Sam through through the chemo-valley.</p></li>
<li><p>We snuck Tina home for a few days so that she could take care of some of her own medical needs. She came back to us with her heart-bucket filled having connected with family and a few friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam has able to connect with friends online and with a new friends here at the RMH.</p></li>
<li><p>The Frickers visited on Sunday. I love seeing Sam’s face brighten as he spends time with his cousin Kaden.</p></li>
<li><p>Last night David and Krista C. were able to visit. So good to catch up with friends and have normal conversation. They also brought personal care-card from Sam’s classmates which he loved. Krista also gifted her with her cookies – dangerously good.</p></li>

<li><p>We are thankful to be through the valley of round five.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam is in good spirits about the upcoming process (i.e.&nbsp;bone-marrow-transplant). He knows it will be tough but he also knows that it has an end. It is hard to see him carry all of this. He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together. Top of mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam. We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process.

  <title>A day of relief</title>

<p>Yesterday morning we wheeled Sam over to one of his clinic visits. We often use a wheelchair to go back and forth to the hospital as Sam’s energy is so low. He still has the strength to walk but not the energy. During these visits Sam’s blood levels are checked as the chemotherapy drugs knock them back, and we need to be sure he does not get knocked back too hard. The results of the tests came back and his hemoglobin and platelet numbers were low enough that he would have to spend an addition three hours in clinic receiving transfusions… but this time was worth it.</p>
<p>It is amazing what some additional blood can do. Following the clinic Sam walked most of the way back to the RMH. He took the stairs. He enjoyed dinner. He wanted to wrestle and he spent lots of energy teasing us. … So good to see our Sam be himself!</p>
<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concerns-and-victories">Concerns and victories</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We are all exhausted. Sam has to carry the greatest burden with undergoing this treatment. Tina and I are there to walk with him each step of the way and to provide all the parental care and also practical nursing care. I don’t think I look to see the end of this storm anymore … rather I just hold on.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday provided some relief from our fatigue – So good to see Sam have some energy again.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that there is a plan. However:<br>
The challenge with all of these plans is that we are in unknown territory. I stated early on that Sam’s cancer is very rare. The reality is that it is essentially unknown. In the world, there has been only one other documented case of this form of cancer. So, all of these plans are based in professional judgement/ best-guess. We are thankful for our medical team that is able provide guidance, but we recognize that there is no standard protocol for Sam’s cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a long list of new concerns which I am yet to process. Top of mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Although it seems there are good matches for Sam, a donor needs to be willing to make a donation, and all the logistics of timing and delivery need to come together.</li>

<p>Day 139, we are at the Ronald McDonald House as the impacts of the latest chemo-drug deliveries take hold. Once again we are heading into the valley. Each round gets harder as Sam is continually beat down by this treatment regime. Truth be told at this point the treatment seems as bad as the disease, but we must push on. Mucositis is worse again with intense nausea. Sam has been experiencing pain deep in his bones as his body works so hard (based on his last PET scan his bone density is falling). We are doing ‘ok’ in the management of these symptoms by utilizing higher doses of morphine and nausea control medications.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I feel I need a quick disclaimer here as I am not sure I have all of this right. In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there … dates and details are likely to change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>During last week’s clinic visits we gained some more clarity on the planned treatment for Sam.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sam will complete the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.<br>
There had been some discussion about skipping the 6<sup>th</sup> round and going straight to bone-marrow-transplant (BMT) but there was just too many moving parts. The team needed more time to line everything up. This means we have about six weeks remaining in this treatment regime before pivoting to BMT.</p></li>
<li><p>In preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam’s health going into BMT.</p></li>
<li><p>Bone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is estimated to be <em>Nov.&nbsp;2</em> .<br>
Following the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0. Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Days -12 to -8</em> (~Oct.&nbsp;16): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Days -7 to -2</em>: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam’s own immune system.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Day -1</em>: General full body radiation to ensure Sam’s own immune system is completely removed – in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Day zero</em>, currently planned for Nov.&nbsp;2, Sam should receive the transplant. This is actually quite simple – like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam’s body via his central line.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Days 0 to 30</em> Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.<br>
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Days 31 through 90</em>: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.</p></li>

<p>Yesterday, Sam completed his fifth round of chemo drug delivery and we were able to leave the hospital (11:pm). Currently, the family is sleeping (Sam, Tina, and Nana)and we don’t have to give any meds for almost two hours.</p>
<p>Very little new information yet. We have had a couple more conversations, and met another doctor. There are definitely a lot of moving parts happening in the background as the various teams need to coordinate schedules and activities.</p>
<p>Moving forward I expect the next couple weeks will become busier and busier. On top of the regular clinic check in days there will be lots of tests to complete, and medical teams to meet. The post below still covers the bulk of what we know.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This morning, <em>August 26</em>, I am writing from Sam’s hospital room. He is here for the planned delivery of his fifth round of chemotherapy. Sam is sleeping well. I slept ‘ok’ but my mind has been busy as I process the results and recommendations from yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday we reviewed the results of the latest PET scan with Sam’s oncologist and clinical nurse. The good news is that the cancerous masses have been reduced further and that there is no new cancer. The challenge is that the rate of reduction in Sam’s cancer will not be enough to see it removed by the end of either this or the next round. We must consider further treatment options.</p>
<p>Following his current treatment Sam will most likely transition to a bone-marrow-transplant treatment protocol. This will involve:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Radiation</p></li>
<li><p>Further intense chemotherapy (drugs)</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation – though Tina and I will still be able to be with him, Sam will be sequestered in a special room during the transplant period of 4-6 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Significantly more time here at BC Childrens to accommodate all of this.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Amazingly, we already know that there a several good transplant matches for Sam!</p>
<p>There will be many meetings upcoming as new plans are made, and as we transfer his care to the bone-marrow transplant team. Although this is hard, I don’t think we would have been satisfied with anything less. This is the best option for Sam and it should provide life-long defense against this cancer.</p>

<p>Round 4 is officially complete. It has been a rough one with little relief. The previous rounds Sam would usually have 2-4 days of feeling more normal… This past round hardly let up. As he was starting to feel a little better he was hit with another bought of nausea and mucositis.</p>
<p>Sam has a very significant clinic appointment today.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We should receive the results of the lasted PET scan and lumbar-puncture</p></li>
<li><p>The medical team may be ready to present recommendations for treatment – will a bone marrow transplant be necessary?</p></li>
<li><p>Round 5 is likely to start today. This will begin with five days in hospital for chemo-drug delivery.</p></li>

<p>All this to say, I am a little anxious this morning.</p>

<p>As far as medical procedures, it was a mostly uneventful week… too uneventful. We had the usual clinic check-ins. Sam only needed one transfusion this round (platelets). Friday, Sam was scheduled to have a PET. This scan generates a 3-dimensional image of his body and where the cancer is in it. However, maintenance issues caused this scan to be postponed – hopefully Sam can get in this Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rest of the week was focused on the management of Sam’s side-effects. We have had to be very strict with the scheduling his medications this round. We have seen decent success in managing his nausea and some success in managing his pain. Sam’s energy levels have been low, and his bone ache as his marrow is in full production mode to restore the blood that was destroyed in this last round of chemo.</p>

<p>Two great reports from the weekend!</p>

<li><p>My parents were down and though our visits were fairly short, given Sam’s energy levels, it was great to see them. Of course they brought Buddy and he was a joy to all including numerous other families that stopped to meet him near the Ronald McDonald House entrance.</p></li>
<li><p>The community driven <em>Fish for a Wish</em> event was held out at Aleza Lake. It sounds like it was a great day for everyone who attended! The numbers are still be finalized but there is a significant donation to support Sam in this cancer journey. We are amazed and humbled at the support of the community! Thank you!</p></li>

<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>PET scan should happen this week.</p></li>
<li><p>This weeks clinic appointments are significant. The medical team will be meeting to discuss Sam’s case either today or tomorrow morning. From that meeting we expect that recommendations will be made regarding next steps. Specifically, will there be a need for a bone-marrow transplant? If ‘no’ then we will finish the current plan, likely wrapping up the main treatment by the end of October. If ‘yes’, following this treatment plan (near the end of Oct.), Sam will likely start the bone-marrow transplant protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Round 5 is planned to start this coming Friday.</p></li>

<li><p>I am amazed at our community, their support, and their gifts.</p></li>
<li><p>I am amazed the medical tech. that is available to support the decision making here. Sure the PET was delayed but we have access to this and the delay is simply an inconvenience.</p></li>
<li><p>We are very appreciative of all the support, notes of encouragement, and other communications. Tina wishes that she had capacity to respond to these. Her on-going health concerns are the major cause of her inability to reply. Please know that your messages to her have been received and are held dear … despite any lack of response on her part.</p></li>
<li><p>This round has been a challenge with much stronger side-effects causing pain and nausea. We have adapted and learned how to manage much of it. The pain in particular has been most difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>This week, likely tomorrow, we expect that major decisions will be discussed regarding Sam’s future treatment – specifically determining if Sam will need a bone-marrow transplant.</p></li>

<p>Sam has made it past the halfway mark of the fourth round of chemotherapy. We have been told from the beginning that we would need to remain flexible and adapt as each round would be different. There are so many changes each round, to the drug mix, to the cancer, to Sam’s body that it is not possible to know what the impacts will be each time. To date, it seemed that each round was getting easier and I had grown to expect that pattern to continue. However, this round turned our expectations up-side-down.</p>
<p>It has been a storm. Following our last clinic appointment Sam’s medications were adjusted, and this new medication plan have made things easier. By yesterday, it seems we have his nausea and pain mostly under control and options for when it is not. So what happened?</p>
<p>Our experience and discussion with the medical team point the majority of this points to a strong case of <a href="https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/aftercareinformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=ack5321">mucositis</a> a common side-effect which results in the breakdown the mucus layer protecting the inside of the digestive track.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the last few days Sam and I have enjoyed boy-time together. As Sam’s energy levels are low from a mix of the side-effects and medications we have probably had too much screen-time, and too much junk food – though I will let Sam eat anything these days in order to get calories into him.</p></li>
<li><p>Tina has been in Edmonton area as our representative at Kurt and Marielle’s wedding. From the video-feed, and Tina’s descriptions and photos it looked like an amazing day! Sam and I were able congratulate Kurtis via FaceTime.</p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday we had a great visit with our friend Wes S.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Clinic appointments and likely blood transfusions as the chemo brings Sam’s blood counts down dangerously low.</p></li>
<li><p>PET scan at the end of this week.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Fish for a Wish</em> event will be happening at Aleza Lake is happening this Saturday, August 19. There will be games, a bouncy castle, a silent auction, fishing, and the option to camp out. This year the community has chosen to support Sam!<br>
If you don’t know what I am talking about and you would like to attend send me a note and I will send you a Facebook invite.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>We are so excited that Tina was able to travel and attend wedding of Kurtis and Marielle F. A beautiful celebration, and great to share it with family and friends there.</p></li>
<li><p>This round has been a challenge with much stronger side-effects causing pain and nausea. In addition, Sam has reduced energy levels and appetite.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that recent changes to Sam’s daily medications have alleviated most of the pain and nausea. I hope that Sam get’s some level of appetite back.</p></li>
<li><p>There is concern that Sam will need further treatment (bone marrow transplant). There is always concern that the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.</p></li>

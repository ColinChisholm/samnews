<!-- 
Since last post: 

W04 Long clinic day (Mahah is Sam's nurse today)
    - Bloodwork 
    - Christina played Mario Kart with Sam.  I think he enjoyed teaching as much as playing
    - Jacob confirms the plan
    - Nivo started
  - Sam visits Oakland and encourages him -- Oakland has a BMT scheduled.
  - Afternoon nap 
  - Franny, River and Emory arrive 
  - WhiteSpot in Kits as a family
R05 A rest day 
    - Nivo seems to be hitting Sam hard.  ... or is it the disease? 
      - Sam is sweaty and achy
      - Tina and I are independently terrified. 
      - I almost broke standing in line for dinner.  All these families they are all going 
        through trauma but they still have their children.  How long will I have my boy?
        Hope seemed lost. 
    - I ran our to Burnaby to get the next refill of Rux.
    - During that time Tina and Sam played a video game! Sam had patience to teach Tina and she did it!
    - Out to Breka. Sam's initiative -- despite how he is feeling.
    - Dave and Rhoda came and visited.  Sam clicks with them so easily.
      - pokemon cards
      - sharing other hobbies (Dave had done them all.)
    - Night: extra itchy (hydroxyzine), ativan for something ..., breakthrough needed for referred pain in back -- disease,
      another effusion -- Sam was no long comfortable to lay on his back.
F06 - slow morning 
    - Clinic and echocardiogram -- no concerns
    - Cal visits -- but Sam is too tired to visit 
S07 - morning ride -- flat tire in Richmond -- Skytrain back
    - slow morning 
    - I am concerned with Sam's lack of activity -- leads to conflict. I think that Sam may also be spending more energy on pain management limiting his ability to live.
    - Frickers and Nana visit.  Fs take Tina out for dinner
    - Sam visits with Nana and does make it down to visit for a 1/2 hour
D08 - Bike ride 
    - Sam chenge meds to 100 / 90 under suspicion that E was being spent on pain management -- seemed to work
    - Sam showers 
    - quiet morning
    - Abbotsford Spaghetti Factory with Cedars grade 11 -- Sam rides bus into Van (6:30 - 9:30).  Before the class arrived we loaded Sam with his afternoon prednisone and a small breakthrough morphine.
M09 - SAM NOTES: He has been sweating everyday/night (not every hour)
    - Clinic 
    - YWAM -- walk Gastown to Abbot st. and back to Victory Park, then to Library.  Sam did amazing
    - Watching shows -- Alone (3 of us), Young Sheldon (Sam and I)
T10 - Quiet day -- allowing Sam to rest 
    - by ~4:30 Sam was ready to engage with class 
    - 5:30 Dinner on Commercial Drive (Jamacan)
    - Church on Frances -- YWAM lead students through pornography and sex trade exploitation.  Boys talk together for 2 hours. 
W11 - Clinic in the am.  This was quite straight forward.  Though Sam loved connectnig 
    -

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-full-week">A full week</h2>
<p>It has been a good week. Sam’s classmates from Cedars Christian School were here and Sam was able to join them a number of times. Time with his friends was such an encouragement to Sam – and to Tina and me.</p>
<section id="times-with-classmates" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="times-with-classmates">Times with classmates!</h3>
<p>This past Sunday evening the <a href="https://cedars.bc.ca">Cedars</a> Grade 11’s rolled into Abbotsford. We were able to join them there – sharing a meal at the Old Spaghetti Factory. After dinner Sam hopped on the bus and experienced a glimpse of the fun had in transit. In Vancouver, near Commercial and Hastings, the crew moved into a local church that would be their home away from home. Sam had a great visit that evening before the three of us returned to RMH.</p>
<p>I am so thankful to Cedars and the hosting YWAM team as they always welcomed Sam and were able to allow Sam to join in as he had energy.</p>
<p>I am incredibly impressed with <a href="https://www.ywamvancouver.org/mission-adventures">YWAM’s Mission Adventures</a> program – it is really well designed, and their staff did an excellent job of leading the students through all the activities. I am also incredibly impressed with the Cedars team (staff, parent chaperones, and all the students!). They all served, and engaged one another and all the ideas presented to them really well – through some very full days and intense topics.</p>

<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Students were split into small groups (3-4) to experience two sides of Vancouver. The east is in the throes of poverty, addiction, and common mental health issues. In stark contrast, mere blocks to the west, the business district is characterized by affluent wealth seemingly ignorant to the challenges in the east.</p>
<p><em>Sam was able to join this day for a couple of hours. He spent over an hour walking – more than he has done in long-long time. He loved sharing this time with classmates, interactions with the people, though this large energy output had consequences. Days later Sam is still trying to restore his energy reserves.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Students served at a number of different ministries assisting the east-side community during the day. In the evening YWAM led the students through a seminar presenting the issues of pornography, sex trafficking, and highlighting the links to violence against women – intense yet important topics. The reflective work for these topics were set into the context of a prayer vigil.</p>
<p><em>Sam was able to rally energy to join the students for their evening meal (Jamaican) followed by the evening session back at the church. It was a privilege to see the students continue to work through the material after the session. They got it. They wrestled with it. They cared.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Students experienced other cultures through their religions touring a Mosque, Buddist, and Sikh temples.</p>
<p><em>Sam had clinic that morning and was still recovering from Monday’s walk, so he was not able to attend the temple tours. Later in the day, following a solid nap, Sam had enough energy to connect with his class once again. First, there was dinner out (Indian), then it was back to the church for a debrief session.</em></p>
<p>It was during this debrief session that Sam’s classmates pressed in around him, and took time to pray for him. … It was simply beautiful to experience the love his friends poured out to him.</p>
<p>To end the evening the whole group walked to get ice cream – gelato. Thirty kids-in-a-candy-store (including adults) as we tried to decide what 2 of 238 flavours to choose from!</p>

<p>We did not get to see them off but the students packed up and started their trip home to Prince George.</p>
<p><em>Sam woke up that morning expressing how he has such a great life. His heart had been filled. He experienced and knows that he is loved.</em></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-connections">Additional connections</h3>
<p>Love extended to our family was not limited to the Cedars group. Since our last post Dave and Rhoda, Nana, the Frickers, and Uncle Cal have all been able stop in.</p>
<p>Sam has also had on his heart to extend care to another young man who is currently at BCCH<sup>1</sup> and is expected to undergo a BMT in the weeks ahead. Sam has initiated stopping by to encourage him a number of times in the last couple of weeks.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="medical-status" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="medical-status">Medical status</h2>
<p>There has been so much beauty in the interactions that we have had this past week.<br>
These interactions have been full of loving-friendship/care and have not failed to acknowledge that Sam’s journey is so challenging.</p>
<p>The previous week Sam was able to have another dose of Nivolumab (Sept 4) – continuing with his immunotherapy. Given the intensity of the events in August the medical team is keeping a close-eye on Sam. By the end of today Sam will have had four clinic visits and two echocardiograms since the last post. To date the clinic visits have been good/simple and without any drama.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><strong><em>Is the immunotherapy working?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>This is a common question that we receive and it is a very important question.</p>
<p>However, it is not one that I can answer – at least not yet. It is not possible to monitor the development of Sam’s cancer on a daily or even weekly basis. We have to wait 3-4 weeks before we can evaluate if the treatment is working.</p>
<p>To-date, since reaching theoretically therapeutic levels of Nivolumab, Sam has not been able to have uninterrupted treatment without other complications causing delays. One of our current hopes is that we will be able to continue with immunotherapy treatment without interruption, so we can have a proper evaluation if the immunotherapy is working.</p>
<p>So we continue to wait and we continue to do the hard work of hope.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have lifted/blessed all three of us.</p></li>
<li><p>The cancer has grown (as of Sept.&nbsp;3 CT scan).</p></li>
<li><p>To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this disease. We need a miracle.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer. He has continued with his immunotherapy – had another dose of Nivolumab (Sept.&nbsp;4). It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further complications that could restrict the use of the drug.</p></li>
<li><p>Waves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.</p></li>
<li><p>Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this journey.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sam’s heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">pericardial effusion</a>. We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well (Aug.&nbsp;23). Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made it through again!</p></li>
<li><p>We are celebrating the success of Sam’s stent surgery (Aug.&nbsp;15, see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">here</a>). The outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein).</p></li>
<li><p>It was amazing to see Sam join the <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the hospital. The <a href="https://rmhbc.ca">Ronald McDonald House (RMH)</a> has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the <a href="https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca">Westwood Church</a> office.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post: 

POST: focus on the state of the disease?

R29: @RMH. Sam was much more rested and was able to enjoy the day.  Our for ice cream and JJ Bean, Kaboodals
    I have been able to connect with Landon.  Although a good day Sam powered out by mid-afternoon
F30: @RMH.  Good connection with Landon as we discuss our kids.  
    Cardio clinic including echocardiogram 
    Oncology Clinic: met Dr. Marie-Claude from Canuck.  She suggested that Sam's acid reflux was related to the lack of 
    space in his chest. Juliana and Jacob were there
    Sam explained how he was doing.  He did this wearing flicking the ears on his hat from Daniel and Alex -- very funny for all.  Plans: CT scan on Tuesday. Hope to proceed with Nivolumab on Wednesday.
    Back to RMH.  A relaxed day.  Sam had great energy for the am and clinic but ran out of power for the pm.  Lots of tv and some video games in the afternoon. Sam and I watched Alone.  Later evening Sam had more energy. ... I was done by this point and fell to sleep.
    Tina had a hard evening missing connections/ her people.
S31: Hillhouse family visited: David and Sam talking.  Off to Earnest and Carson's Used Books 
    Sam is enjoying the show Alone
    In the night Sam's chest -- specifically upper sternum was hot
D01: St. John's Anglican Church
    Paul's Omlettery
    Townsends visit -- talks and pizza out at Woodfire Pizza (Cal, Tricia, Jane, Chris)
    ... couldn't believe how much Sam was able to handle! 
M02: Sam had a rough night with lots of additional meds.  We didn't sleep much.  
    It seems the activity of the previous days had caught up with him.
    He rallied by ~3 when the Frickers arrived.  We all had a decent visit (kinda flat)
    Sam seemed to present adrenal deficit a couple times -- after more food and predisone `.5 hours early
    he seemed more alert and engaged. 
    Good evening 
    Sam gaming online with friends: Ben and John; Julia ad Hadance  
T03: CT scan in the am -- straight forward
    Out to Breka Cafe
    Sam gaming online with friends 
    @Clinic 
    Camara and Gaia
    Review of weekend with Jacob and Juliana
    *items to discuss (i.e. Dad's paranoid thoughts)*
    -   Pains -- internal ... itchy on the inside 
    -   Sam style.  I'm feeling good so therefore I will do a lot 
    -   Lot's of joint pains 
    -   Two episodes of what appeared to be adrenal fatigue 
    -   One evening of sweats 
    -   Hot in the chest
    Results:
    -   slight increase 7.1 x 8.1 x 7.3 previous (7.8 x 7.8 x 6.7 August 22)
    -   August 14 7.4 x 6.6 by (7.7 x 6.9 previous)
    -   P. effusion remains small
    Next Steps:
    -   Do nothing as it causes high risk
    -   Give it -- what side effects will we have ... 
    -   Fear of an acute event. 
    -   What do you think:
        -   I would risk an acute event that MAY lead to death rather than no action that WILL lead to death. 
            (not stated: But no action is a death sentence ...)
        -   Sam states well similar 
        -   Tina agrees 
    -   ALternate therapies -- why we are doing what we are doing ... 
    -   Sam stop treatments when when it is definitive that the cancer will not win. 


W04
    *QUESTIONS and THOUGHTS*
    -   The cancer is causing new pain ... elevated pain.  
        We need options for managing it.  Morphine is not enough and does not hit is fast enough.  
        Usually come on the evening. 
    -   This cancer seems to grow in fits and start -- surging.  Is this  known pattern 
        or is it unique. Or is this an artefact of mixed methods.


What a conundrum.  Sam is the healthiest he has been in this journey.  He is able to enjoy life.  He has a thirst for life.  In the early mornings he rolls over and says to me that there is so much that he wants to do (still not sure how conscious he was). He also added ... with you dad!

What Sam wants -- to share of the love and hope he has in Jesus. "Pain is temporary -- hope is eternal."

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thank you for your love and prayers. I am sending a message I sent Shan recently (to avoid a lengthy rewrite) It is not necessarily edited and may feel raw?! But you need to have an update about what’s happening. We are still fighting so we praise God for this chance 🙌🙌🙌</p>
<p>We were in clinic until about 5:30pm then had dinner together …. The CT scan showed that the cancer has grown. Thankfully, however, it has not grown so much that our Dr won’t offer treatment. We had a long serious discussion with Dr Jacob about proceeding with more immunotherapy considering the potential (fatal) risks. It was actually an amazing discussion. Sam showed such courage and strength and honesty that Jacob (and our nurse clinician Julianna) were amazed and almost in tears. Sam said that he would rather die quickly trying to fight the cancer than giving up treatment and suffering slowly. Colin and I are also in agreement with this statement. So Sam will have immunotherapy again tomorrow morning (unless there is something really off with the bloodwork) with the understanding that we have to stay very close to the hospital and have frequent monitoring for the next while (week and a half?). We are also going to go up on one of Sam’s pills (trying to reach therapeutic levels of that medicine) (that in theory - only in controlled experiments - may be shown to help fight cancer). So it has been stressful and heavy again but Sam is courageous and we continue to go forward in faith together …. Also believing this continues to be the next reasonable thing to do. Sam continues to choose joy and wants to have an evening of the three of us just being together doing things. We really really value your prayers and presence with us on this journey. It is extremely important to us and we are so grateful for your love and care ❤️</p>

<section id="treatment-review" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-review">Treatment review</h3>
<p>If you have been following Sam’s story you know that in the current chapter of immunotherapy (i.e.&nbsp;post-chemotherapy, post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug Nivolumab has been challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When it was first given at the end of February Sam’s liver became inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it again. During this period the cancer grew.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam restarted Nivolumab in June paired with another drug, Ruxolitinib, to control side effects. Sam’s body tolerated this well but dosing was likely below therapeutic levels. At the beginning of August scans demonstrated that the cancer had continued to grow.</p></li>
<li><p>In the first week of August Sam received a single dose of Nivolumab at what was believed to be a therapeutic level. However, by this time the cancer was having impacts on Sam’s heart. In the weeks following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein returning blood from much of Sam’s upper body to his heart. The second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect. Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these surgeries – his body needed time to heal.</p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday’s scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August, had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with treatment – understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam.</p></li>

<li><p>The cancer has grown (as of Sept.&nbsp;3 CT scan).</p></li>
<li><p>Sam is looking to fight on despite continued growth of the cancer. He will continue with his immunotherapy – have another dose of Nivolumab. It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further complications that could restrict the use of the drug.</p></li>
<li><p>Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this journey.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam’s heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">pericardial effusion</a>. We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made it through again!</p></li>
<li><p>We are celebrating the success of Sam’s stent surgery (see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">here</a>). The outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)</p></li>
<li><p>To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.</p></li>
<li><p>It was amazing to see Sam join the <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post 

F23: Pericardiocentisis 
S24: Most of the day in the ICU.  Everything was calm.  Mostly just waiting.  By the end of that evening we had 
    some concerns regarding how much fluid Sam was retaining.  Nurses Jade (in ICU), and Laura on T8.  Nigel at night.
D26: Dr. Eva - cardiologist visited.  Again told of how well Sam had done in surgery. How beautiful it had been 
    to see his heart re-inflate as the pressure came off. Dr. Cathy, Oncologist on call checked on Sam and in discussion with Tina got some lasix going.  Sam had a rough day.  Frickers tried to visit but he was only willing to see Uncle Kev. Finally, at ~6:00 he was willing to take additional pain meds.  This helped for a bit.  Had to push a little harder for additional meds and a Dr. order to increase pain meds to stay ahead of the pain.  Starting overnight Sam'is now at 90/90 m-eslon plus morphine 5mg Q2 (+15mg every 12)... This amount seems to be effective. Pam was on during the day.  Nigel again at night.
M25: Echo in morning and afternoon.  Cardiology Docs want to leave drain in for the weekend.
    Afternoon meeting with Dr. Jacob.  Cytology is not back.  Lasix through to reduce fluid
    Pam during the day, Maddie at night.
T26: Echo at 8:00am.  Dr. Steven from cardiology, assisted by his fellow, pulled Sam's drain at ~11:00am
    Dr. Peggy following procedure.  Review of meds.  Keep Sam for observation overnight. More lasix to finalize drying him out. 
    Rachelle in the day. Lauren in the night

August 29 Update
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Sam was discharged on yesterday. We are back at the RMH where all three of us are catching up on some much needed rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am writing this morning from the hospital. Much of the intensity of <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-23_highs-lows-surgery.html">last week</a> continued into this week – until yesterday. Yesterday, Sam was able to be disconnected from all the various lines used during this latest hospital stay.</p>
<p>This morning, my heart was filled with joy. It was such a simple thing: Sam got up walked to the bathroom and went back to bed falling back into a restful sleep. These simple actions were beautiful: they were in contrast to how the previous days had been; and they represented freedom and health for my boy.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>It is hard to believe that it is only day five since Sam had his latest surgery. Time has moved very slowly as Sam has had to endure new pains, discomforts, and continuous testing.</p>
<p>I am so glad that Sam had the surgery to remove the excess fluid from around his heart (<a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/tests-treatments-medications/medical-tests/pericardial-drainage">pericardiocentesis</a>). Once again the amazing staff at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Children’s Hospital</a> have saved Sam’s life and we cannot thank them enough.</p>
<p>What is not advertised with surgery is that recovery can take time – especially if there are any complications. The first night went well, but I think I will attribute that to the drugs that Sam was on.</p>
<p>By Saturday evening Sam was feeling gross/very uncomfortable. He has tolerated so much during this journey but he had a hard time with this procedure. The worst of it was that he had a wire tube in his chest and that the tube was sitting up against his heart. The tube was used to continue to drain additional fluid in effort to keep the <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0" class="lightbox">pericardial effusion</a> from returning. To complicate his medical picture following the surgery his fluid balance … went off.</p>
<p>This meant that he was swollen and puffy (e.g.&nbsp;swollen ankles and elbows). This was unexpected. Why this happened did not matter as much as the management of the issue – the team again did a great job of bringing his fluid balance back to normal (using IV medications).</p>

Parent advocacy
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is very important to advocate for your child! The medical teams works hard trying to solve issues that they are seeing. As parents we see the big picture. We know what is normal for Sam and when things are not normal.</p>
<p>In particular, during this past week when it was Tina that drew attention to various symptoms that Sam was facing and requested appropriate intervention (i.e.&nbsp;suggesting the echocardiogram that identified the fluid buildup, and needed fluid management post surgery). Tina is awesome!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each day following the surgery Sam would have one and sometimes two echocardiograms (a specialized ultrasound of the heart) to monitor how the fluid around his heart was resolving.</p>
<section id="freedom" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freedom">Freedom</h3>
<p>Yesterday, metrics of healing were strong enough that Sam could be disconnected<sup>1</sup>. The drainage wire was pulled from his chest the hole was lightly bandaged. The wire was about 5 inches long with at least 1.5 inches were set against the side of his heart – no wonder Sam had been in such discomfort.</p>
<p>In addition, by the end of the day his fluid balance was looking much improved and he able to be disconnected from the IV pole overnight.</p>

<p>It is not clear what all of our next steps are. The past couple of weeks have focused on very acute issues (i.e.&nbsp;stent surgery and pericardial fluid drainage). Though the cancer is likely involved in both of these it was not the focus of treatment.</p>
<p>In the days ahead I expect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>That Sam will be discharged and able to return to the Ronald McDonald House and that we will need to stay close to the hospital.</p></li>

<!-- 
Since last post 
15: note: Nana Mary stayed the night at RMH while Sam and I were at hospital 
16: Friday -- left the hospital.  Cal, Chris, Jane were here.  
17: Sat -- a quiet day at the RMH
18: Sun: Driven Project 
19: Mon: Clinic: liver numbers spiked.  Strategy Games and Hobbies -- Tau empire for Sam    
20: Tues: Clinic again: liver numbers had levelled off but still too high for Nivo.
    That evening we went to the Frickers.  In particular Sam was feeling pretty good
    and was able to engage with family. 
    Sam and I returned to RMH.  Had a nice evening getting to bed just after mid-night. 
    Through the night Sam's pain and nausea were high and difficult to manage 
    Together we decided to go to clinic first thing in the morning.

    A precious conversation with Sam.  First at the Frickers (when he had been resting downstairs), and then on the drive back to RMH. Sam admitted his fears that current pains could be related to the progression of the cancer. It was so good / important to have an honest talk.  I discussed with him that this was a logical possibility and that I shared these fears.  I thanked him for sharing.  Despite this, and given that we have no control, we chose not to be anxious about it, to choose courage.  To choose hope.  To trust that no matter what God has him -- though I know that Sam trusts God better than I do right now.  

*pain had been challenging most evening starting Sunday evening -- initially attributed to higher 
output associated with the Driven Project Activities. Pain management was dominantly use of break-thru
morphine. We were also PEG'ing twice daily to manage constipation but we had not been too concerned as Sam was able to pass small amounts*

21: Wed:  To clinic 
    The team jump into action seeing Sam's pain and nausea.  Resting heart rate of 130
    following immediate interventions of IV ondansetron and some other med reduce reflux pain HR settled to 120.
    Numerous tests.  The most telling of which was the echocardiogram which showed a 
    significant pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart).  Cardiology team were a little 
    stunned to find Sam still walking and talking. Plans are in place to re-evaluate and possibly 
    undergo a procedure to remove the excess fluid from around his heart -- 
    Pico S. was given to address the secondary issue of constipation. 
    Onto the ward for observation overnight. 
    Sam was feeling better through the night.  Resting-HR had reduced further to 90

    In the evening Dave and Krista came by! 

22: Thur:  Sam had a good night.  Resting HR trending to normal now at 85 -- though

<p>This past week started strong. Since my last post Sam was discharged following his successful <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html">stent surgery</a> (Friday Aug. 16). We were not sure what to expect following surgery and Sam did struggle with various pains and lethargy. Despite this, through the week we had good visits with family and some big and small adventures. Saturday (17<sup>th</sup>), Cal, Chris, and Jane were here to visit with Tina and I (Sam was not yet up for visitors). Sunday, Sam had a huge day taking part in the <a href="https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/">Driven Project</a>. Monday was clinic – news was not great (see below) but afterwards we had an afternoon out exploring new games and hobbies at a couple local shops – it felt almost normal.</p>
<p>By Tuesday Sam was feeling more energetic and we got away from the RMH to visit family in Whiterock. In his good moments (when not resting away from the family), it was great to see Sam join in on sharing stories, laughing, and generally sitting freely with his cousins, Aunt, Uncle, and Nana. That evening Sam and I returned to the RMH leaving Tina to enjoy more time with her family.</p>
</section>
<section id="lows" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lows">Lows</h2>
<p>Ack, what a roller coaster this week. Backing up, Monday in clinic Sam’s liver numbers showed a sudden spike upwards. This was confirmed again on Tuesday. Sam had also started battling elevated pains starting back on Sunday evening, making sleep difficult. It was Tuesday night that I was no longer able to keep Sam’s pain under control this was also coupled with nausea. We went to clinic first thing Wednesday morning and the medical team jumped into high gear, taking bloodwork, and setting up various tests (Tina joined us mid-morning). By the end of the day it was confirmed that Sam had fluid pressing on his heart – a <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0">Pericardial Effusion</a>. By that point in the day Sam’s pain and nausea were under control (IV meds were far more effective than what I had available), and it was determined to admit Sam to hospital and reevaluate in the morning.</p>
<!-- That evening Sam's
prayer was that his heart rate would decrease enough that physical
draining for the fluid would not be necessary. -->
<p>Thursday morning things were looking great! Sam’s heart rate continued to trend downward towards normal levels. It seemed surgical intervention would not be needed and we would spend a further 24-hours in hospital for observation. During this evening, it was a great comfort to have Dave and Krista C. visit.</p>
<p>So many parts of this journey have involved swings. Friday morning we returned to chaos and uncertainty. Sam’s heart rate had been trending towards normal most of the night but sometime in the early morning it started building again - returning to significantly elevated levels.</p>

<section id="surgery-intensive-care" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surgery-intensive-care">Surgery &amp; Intensive Care</h2>
<p>As I finish writing this post the three of us are in the intensive care. The day has been very intense but we are now in a good place. Mid-afternoon, the medical team decided that it would be safest for Sam to go forward with a surgery to remove the fluid from his around his heart. By 6:00pm he was in the OR where the doctors pierced through Sam’s upper abdomen and then through the pericardial sac to install a temporary drain. The surgery went as planned without any complications – a litre of excess fluid was drained from around Sam’s heart. It was good to have Uncle Cal with us in the anxious waiting.</p>
<p>Sam is a champion. He did the whole surgery under light anaesthetic – meaning he was awake and aware of what was was happening. Apparently he chatted with one of the doctors through the whole procedure reflecting on how great his time at Ness Lake Bible Camp had been.</p>
<p>He is now in the ICU for observation. He is happy, his vitals are much improved, and he is looking forward to playing games with us and his nurse this evening.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s surgery went better than we had hoped!</p>
<p>The original plan was to install one or two stents to maintain the function of Sam’s limited but existing blood-flow (i.e.&nbsp;reinforce one of his small collateral veins). However, the surgeons<sup>1</sup> presented a new plan. The new ‘Plan A’ would be to reestablish flow through the brachiocephalic vein ! They were hopeful they could reopen the left side. They would fall back to ‘Plan B’ as described in my <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-13_threat-response.html">previous post</a> if they were not able to do so.</p>
<p>Plan A was a success! It took significantly longer than planned but 3.5 hours later the doctors came and talked with us. They were obviously pleased that they were able to do this. Tina and I are are ecstatic! Sam is feeling good! We are currently in the hospital for observation but we expect to be back to the RMH by the end of today.</p>

<p>The left and right bracheocephalic veins were believed to be fully occluded. The right was occluded when we first arrived due to blood clotting associated with the disease. As of last week’s scans the left is also fully blocked.</p>
<p>During yesterday’s surgery the team was able to reestablish flow in the left bracheocephalic and to install a stent there to keep it open. This result gives Sam much more ‘normal’ blood-flow and takes the literal pressure off his collateral vascular network.</p>
<p>In addition, measurements during surgery indicated that the Superior vena cava (SVC) is functioning normally.</p>

<p>Last week Sam’s cancer journey reached a higher level of intensity. This has been a hard journey and now it is downright scary. Threats to Sam’s life are incredibly intense. First, there is the immediate threat-to-life as the cancer has caused significant damage to Sam’s vascular system and now threatens the heart itself. Second, despite the valiant effort of our medical team and Sam’s incredible courage to both understand and take on the treatments, the cancer itself continues to grow (see <a href="../../posts/2408/2024-08-07_scan-results.html">previous post</a>). Medically speaking our options are limited – we need a miracle.</p>
<p>Despite the intensity of the current medical situation in many ways Sam appears to be healthier than he has been since before this disease began.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maintaining-blood-flow">Maintaining blood-flow</h3>
<p>The cancer directly or indirectly has blocked/occluded some of Sam’s major blood vessels<sup>1</sup>. As a result, blood from his head and upper body is being re-routed through an extensive network of small collateral vessels that Sam’s body has developed in compensation.</p>
<p>This past week we met with the intervention radiology surgical team. They have made plans to try to keep Sam’s remaining blood-flow pathways open.</p>
<p>On Thursday August 15 Sam is scheduled to have surgery during which stents will be inserted to maintain existing blood-flow to his heart. One will be placed in a small collateral vein that is returning the bulk of Sam’s upper body blood volume. A second stent will be used to keep the Superior vena cava open.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-scare-er-visit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-scare-er-visit">Additional scare – ER visit</h3>
<p>Given everything that was revealed in the last scan our vigilance has been increased (can it go any higher?). On Sunday evening Sam started to have new/novel pains in his chest – at his heart - and strange pulsing sensations in his neck. So we went into the ER.By the time we arrived and settled in, Sam’s vitals were great. As nothing requiring immediate intervention could be determined, and given that we had a visit planned with Sam’s medical team the next day, we returned to RMH.</p>
</section>
<section id="disease-control" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disease-control">Disease control</h3>
<p>It is unknown if this cancer can be controlled but that does not mean we will stop trying. In response to the latest scans we will push on and push harder. Greater risks must be taken. Treatments must be accelerated.</p>
<p>The original plan was to attempt an increase in Sam’s Nivolumab by doubling the dose. Given the latest results we have chosen to push harder. Wednesday the dose was quadrupled in an effort to find an effective dose – though it will take a few weeks to know if it is having the desired effect.</p>
<p>In addition, Sam is back on high-dose steroids (prednisone). One of the primary reasons to use this drug is to quickly reduce inflammation in the body. Sam has also used it in the past to protect his liver which the Nivolumab can harm. Within 24 hours of starting the drug it was possible to visibly see positive impacts.</p>

<p>This past week it was amazing to have the in-person support of some friends and family from Prince George. We had great visits and times that simply felt normal.</p>
<p>Joel, Joanna, and Chase were here for Friday evening and Saturday. We shared meals, went to a movie (Inside Out 2 – it is great!), made an ice cream run, Chase and Sam threw a football around, and played some video games together.</p>
<p>Sunday and Monday my parents came to spend time with us. The effects of the Nivolumab started to set in on Sunday – causing fatigue. However, that did not stop us from spending time and sharing meals together. Sam loved having his grandparents here. Sam seems to be loving his ice cream these days (could be the prednisone) so to wrap up our time together we celebrated with an ice cream cake that Sam requested from DQ.</p>

<p>The left and right bracheocephalic veins are fully occluded. The right was occluded when we first arrived due to blood clotting associated with the disease. As of last week’s scans the left is also now fully occluded. Sam’s body has adapted rerouting blood through collateral vessels. One of these small vessels returns blood directly into the Superior vena cava (SVC). Blood return through other collaterals is collected by the Azygos vein.</p>
<p>An additional issue is that the SVC is also partially occluded (~50%).</p>
<p>Surgery this week will insert stents to ensure that a) the one collateral returning blood directly to the SVC remains open, and b) That the SVC itself remains open.</p>

<p>This past weekend was filled with the love of family and friends but it carried an underlying inescapable anxiety as we waited for scan results. Yesterday, the fears we battled through the weekend were realized – the cancer has grown. Today Sam received an elevated dose of Nivolumab in an effort to get the cancer under control and again we wait, hope, and pray that one of these treatments will finally work.</p>
<section id="an-anxious-weekend" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-anxious-weekend">An anxious weekend</h2>
<p>Last Friday was filled with numerous appointments the most important being a PET scan to determine the current extent of Sam’s cancer. However, it is a rare day that we get the results on the same day – so we had to wait-out this past long/holiday weekend before getting the results.</p>
<p>In addition, given that Sam has been on morphine for such a long time, on Saturday we attempted a plan (suggested by our doctors) to switch him over to methadone (i.e.&nbsp;start replacing morphine with methadone). I do not fully understand why it did not work but by mid-day-Saturday Sam was writhing in pain. It would take another 36 hours before he would start feeling himself again. During this time we were able be with with Nana and the Fricker family (Saturday and Sunday). We would have loved for Sam to take part more with the family but the medication switch had taken him down – he was able to see everyone but he had very limited capacity to be with the family.</p>
<p>By Monday Sam was feeling better, having returned to his regular drug regime. Mid-day we had a nice visit/lunch with friends, Donna and Ciaro, whom we had met through RMH. In the evening we saw the Townsends. It was great to see Sam feeling better and he was even able to enjoy a game with his cousins. We were back at the RMH for the night as we had clinic the next morning.</p>
</section>
<section id="scan-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scan-results">Scan results</h2>
<p>It had been a long wait through the weekend to finally get to clinic yesterday and hear the results of last week’s scans. As always our medical team was amazing, especially given the hard task before them. The results are not what any of us wanted. The cancer had grown again. In retrospect, now that we have enough scans of the same type (i.e.&nbsp;not mixing results from different types of scans), it seems that the cancer has grown fairly consistently and none of the medicinal treatments have had measurable impacts at slowing the disease. Additional concerns were also raised as this disease is having further impacts on Sam’s vascular system as it grows into and around some of Sam’s major vessels and heart. The left and right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_vein">brachiocephalic veins</a> are blocked by impacts of the disease (the main veins transporting blood from Sam’s head to his heart). Sam’s body has adapted as he has an extensive network of smaller/collateral vessels that move the blood around this blockage. Flow is also partially restricted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava">superior vena cava</a>, the major collection chamber for blood returning to the heart from the upper body – again caused by the cancer.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Today, Sam received a dose of Nivolumab at a rate 4-times what he has received previously. This increased dose was done in effort to find a level that may show some effect. However, in doing so we recognize that this may also cause side effects that we have been hoping to avoid. He will remain in hospital for monitoring overnight and if he remains stable he may be discharged to the RMH over the weekend.</p>
<p>Next week Sam will have another contrast-CT in an attempt to image if any impacts can be measured.</p>
<p>So how are we doing through all of this you ask? It would be a lie to say we are not scared. The disease has been a constant threat and now more than ever. However, there are great moments of joy. It is impossible not to smile when Sam wakes from a nap with a big smile on his face saying “<em>I’m so happy.</em>” He is happy – he knows he is cared for and he knows that he is loved.</p>
</section>
<section id="victories-and-concerns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="victories-and-concerns">Victories and concerns</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The cancer has grown and the impacts of the disease are threatening Sam’s vascular system and thereby his life.</p></li>
<li><p>To date medicines have not had any significant effect at controlling this disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.</p></li>
<li><p>It was amazing to see Sam join the <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care. The <a href="https://rmhbc.ca">Ronald McDonald House (RMH)</a> has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the <a href="https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca">Westwood Church</a> office.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all through this journey.</p></li>

<p>I am currently writing in the dark as Sam is having a nap, waiting for his turn in the PET scan machine. I would be lying if I said that all of us are feeling great this morning. The reality is that scan days are always stressful as they mark significant chapters in Sam’s treatment. They mark significant pivot points where treatment plans are adjusted – either to keep going with the treatment regime or change it up. Perhaps today’s scan is all the more stressful as it is to determine if one of our last treatment options (immunotherapy combined with a new medication) is working or not. Additionally, being back in Vancouver and being under the watchful eye of our medical team is in stark contrast to the freedom, fun-living, and joy had with friends this past week.</p>
<section id="an-amazing-week-at-home" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-amazing-week-at-home">An amazing week at home!</h2>
<p>I am still stunned at how good this last week has been! Since my last post:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Saturday</dt>
<dd>
<p>This day was a turning point. Most of this day and all of the days prior that week Sam had been feeling the effects of his immunotherapy drugs – generally wiped-out/lethargic and achy.</p>
<p>In the evening he had a return of energy and the Bandstra, Claus, and Cross families rearranged their plans and came over. We had a great summer evening in the back yard talking and playing games. Sam was especially encouraged receiving the care of friends.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sunday</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tina and I made it to church… well we made it in the door and then spent the time connecting with people. Sam slept in that morning but gave me a call asking to come greet people following the service. It was encouraging for all!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the evening, Sam having heard from his friends the night before about how great working at <a href="https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com">Ness Lake Bible Camp</a> was, he asked to go and visit – which we did. However, Sam wasn’t satisfied with visiting and by the end of the evening he had spent several hours working in the kitchen or wherever else he was able.<br>
<!-- five hours at camp --></p>
</dd>
<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>
<p>We figured that Sam would need a rest day – we were wrong! That afternoon Tina took Sam out to camp again where he worked, visited, and took part in cabin time with the kids!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>That evening some of the church leaders came by to support and pray with us and for Sam – more encouragement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>I spent the morning at work – made it out to the forest. It was great to be there again. Also, to connect with my work-world people!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sam was not going to miss out, and he was out to serve at camp again. Tina had expected to take him home at any point, but he stayed until late in the evening! He even had energy for the evening <em>Safari</em> game where leaders dress up as animals and the campers have to <em>hunt</em> them. He had an amazing time. Though a fall during the game resulted in us putting him in an air-cast. An x-ray, if needed, will be completed while we are here in Vancouver. This leg pain was all worth the experience of joining the team.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a family, we focused on packing up to be ready to head south.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sam was thinking he would have a rest day but having received an invite from camp to join in on activities, he was not going to miss out. That evening Sam, although hobbling with the air-cast, took part in work projects, discussion times, and then the end-of-week <em>button ceremony</em> where Sam was awarded two buttons. The encouragement definitely went both ways: camp leaders were so impressed with Sam, while Sam had his heart-bucket filled to overflowing.<br>
<br>
From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6Wbygpy8NLnhsAvp/">Dave Horton’s post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sam Chisolm earned his summer team shirt and both director pins (which does not happen ever)…</p>
<ul>
<li>for serving others (through some physical pain) before himself</li>
<li>for going from a visitor to “what can I do to help.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Dude helped with dishes, A team, camper supervision and more. We could not find enough for him to do.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tina, Sam, and I have been so encouraged by these days that Sam had in camp. It was amazing to see him rise and have the energy to engage. Amazing to see the joy he had. A huge thank you to all of the Ness Lake Crew – thank you for welcoming Sam onto the team!</p>
<dl>
<dt>Thursday</dt>
<dd>
<p>We got away from Prince George in great time. Had a great visit with family in Langley and then settled into the RMH that evening.</p>

<p>I can understand it if you were feeling like you were missing our on our lives and wondering what is going on – it has been over two weeks since I last wrote.</p>
<p>In that time we were at home, travelled to Vancouver, and returned home again. During our times at home, we had some good visits with a number of our friends here, and I started to feel that I was maybe beginning to recover from burnout. Sam, of course, despite often feeling physically exhausted from it all, continues to be amazing, maintaining his positive attitude throughout this long journey.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>Most recently, last Thursday, July 18, we made a roadtrip down to BC Children’s. We chose to drive as it allows for more flexible timing and gives us some freedom while there. On that Friday, there was a minor question-mark related to some of Sam’s bloodwork and the team chose: to adjust some of Sam’s supporting medications<sup>1</sup>, and to wait out a cold that he had.</p>
<p>Over the weekend we were able to have a visit with the Frickers and Nana including a nice afternoon watching the tide come in at Crescent Beach.</p>
<p>The next Monday Sam’s cold and bloodwork had improved and he was able to receive another dose of Nivolumab. In addition an echocardiogram showed that there were no significant negative impacts on Sam’s heart. Despite not leaving the clinic until 4:30 that afternoon we decided to start our trip home. We made it to Kamloops that night and the rest of the way on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This last trip down marks our shortest visit to BC Children’s Hospital and the Ronald McDonald house. It is our hope that this will become a more normal pattern. Yet it is too soon to discuss patterns or plans for life.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-forward" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>On August 2<sup>nd</sup> Sam is due back in Vancouver. We will spend several days there as he is scheduled for a PET scan, an ultrasound, and another dose of Nivolumab.</p>
<p>In the meantime we have just over a week at home. We are loving it here – however in some ways it is a strange adjustment (including not having Tina’s parents here). Many thanks to whoever mowed our backyard! In this time we will celebrate birthdays, I will get to work for some part days, and we hope to continue reconnecting with our Prince George friends and family.</p>

<p>It has been a week-and-a-half since my last post. Despite some challenges the overall picture is good as Sam’s body has tolerated the new combination of medications. In addition, the MRI scan showed that the cancer has not grown since the previous scan.</p>

<section id="june-29th" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="june-29th">June 29<sup>th</sup></h3>
<p>We have had a few challenges since I last wrote – I am glad they are not all focused on Sam.</p>
<p>The last weekend of June was tough. Tina and I celebrated our 28<sup>th</sup> anniversary (love you Tina!) while visiting Nana in White Rock (the Frickers were away). Sam had received his dose of Nivolumab a week earlier and what we now know/remember is that it takes about a week for effects and corresponding pains to set in. One of the hardest things in this whole journey is to watch your child when they are in pain and to not understand what is causing it. Over the next couple days we were able to get his pain under control allowing to feel himself again.</p>
<p>Also that weekend, Nana Mary was having some heart related symptoms that gave us a scare – she seems to be good now.</p>
<p>To celebrate our anniversary, instead of going out for dinner, Tina and I chose to stay in and eat with our beloved Sam and mother Mary. It was a good evening, despite the uncertainty of everything going on.</p>
</section>
<section id="july-6---8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="july-6---8">July 6 - 8</h3>
<p>In addition to waiting for these situations to resolve, one reason that this post is a few days late coming is that this past weekend I was laid flat. A head cold took all my energy for the better part of Saturday through Monday.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="current-medical-situation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-medical-situation">Current medical situation</h2>
<p>Sam’s medical situation over the last couple weeks is generally good news!</p>
<p>First, Sam’s body is tolerating the latest mix of medications – specifically, <a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_monograph.pdf">Nivolumab</a> and <a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Ruxolitinib_monograph.pdf">Ruxolitinib</a>. The initial attempt to use Nivolumab, at the end of Feb., did not go well and resulted in lost time recovering from side effects (primarily liver inflammation). Currently, the combination of these two drugs seems to be working well – specifically, metrics related to Sam’s liver are stable and even in normal ranges.</p>
<p>Sam also had an MRI of his chest last week the results of which were encouraging. Though it is too soon to tell, or to relate the scan to the latest drug regime, the results indicated that the cancerous mass had not grown (in contrast to the previous PET scan). We are once again hopeful that the cancer can be held back/ controlled. The MRI also provided incredible details of Sam’s upper body and the medical team will continue to review this latest set of images to evaluate future treatment options.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe, but a pattern to life may be starting to emerge. We have learned (along with every oncology family we know) that we must be cautious in having plans as anything or everything can change at anytime. However, we are now starting to make plans with our medical team that extend beyond the next clinic visit. Given that Sam is tolerating the medications we are starting to look to the weeks ahead.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sam will need to be in Vancouver every two weeks to receive the dose of Nivolumab.</li>
<li>Coupled with this approximately every four weeks he will have some sort of scan (likely alternating between PET and CT)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam received his latest dose this past Friday and yesterday’s numbers looked good.</p>
<p>Given that there is nothing to do here in Vancouver until July 19, we plan to head for home tomorrow!</p>

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Sam's immunotherapy treatment has been delayed. We hope to see this
    treatment start by the end of this week.
-   GVHD effects have continued since Sam received his BMT. One effect
    of GVHD is that fluid has accumulated around his heart making it
    unsafe with other treatments until that is dealt with.

<p>Following a delay Sam’s treatment is now going forward.</p>
<p>Sam is on a new mix of medications that will hopefully slow the cancer and empower his immune system to attack the cancer. The two main immunotherapy drugs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_monograph.pdf">Nivolumab</a> – is referred to as a check point inhibitor. Essentially, this drug disables a protein that allows the cancer cells to hide from the immune system. The downside is that it intensifies GVHD.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Ruxolitinib_monograph.pdf">Ruxolitinib</a> – is being used to offset the impacts of GVHD. Some research suggests that this medication may also be synergistic with Nivolumab.</li>
</ul>
<p>We continue to be in Vancouver as Sam starts these treatments. We need to be sure that Sam can tolerate this new set of medications so potential adverse side effects are being monitored. The medical team also wants to keep a close eye on the cancer – a new scan of Sam’s chest is scheduled for next week (an MRI).</p>

<section id="medical-plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="medical-plans">Medical plans</h2>
<p>We had to know if Sam’s new immune system from the BMT would be able to stop the cancer – we now know that it cannot. The results of the June<sup>12th</sup> PET scan simply sucked – the cancer had grown, and likely spread into two lymph nodes close by.</p>
<p>So we pivot and move onto the next plan which will be a combination of different immunotherapy drugs. Past research suggest that these drugs could be effective at 1) interrupting a key metabolic pathway in the cancer cells, and 2) disable some of the cancer’s defenses that allow it to hide from the immune system.</p>
<p>Last Friday we were hoping to see Sam start on this modified immunotherapy drug treatment plan, but it was not safe to do so. Since receiving his BMT<sup>1</sup> Sam has had some level of GVHD<sup>2</sup>. One ongoing effect of GVHD is that fluid has built up around his heart (measured using an echocardiogram). To date this has not impacted his heart function. The challenge and safety concern is that the new immunotherapy treatment will likely intensify GVHD impacts that could put his heart at risk.</p>
<p>So instead of treating the cancer, last week Sam was started on a steroid to reduce GVHD effects. Yesterday, a repeat echocardiogram and blood metrics suggest that this GVHD treatment is working and this should allow Sam to start on the immunetherapy/cancer-treatment later this week.</p>

<p>Two days ago, Wednesday June 12, Sam had his latest PET scan. Yesterday afternoon the three of us met with Sam’s doctor to review the results.</p>
<p>The results are unfavourable – they are not what we want. Sam is still in the fight and there are still medical options to pursue. So, despite taking a hit, we hold hope and prepare for the next steps.</p>
<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The latest scan showed growth of the central mass in Sam’s chest. The cancer has expanded, it is not by a lot but it is distinct and beyond any possible measurement errors. In addition, two lymph-nodes in close proximity to the cancer show increased activity – we have to assume that the disease is now there as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>The last few weeks have been a test to determine if Sam’s new immune system could battle the cancer on its own. Unfortunately, this test failed. During that time Sam has also had some of his best living. We were able to be home and he was able to enjoy his life, time with friends, and time learning at school.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Sam’s treatment plan will involve the re-introduction of some immune-therapy drugs. Nivomulab is an check-point-inhibitor will be given at a lower dose than previous. Other medications will be introduced in an attempt to reduce the more intense graft-versus-host impacts that Nivomulab has caused in the past.</p>
<p>Sam will also be closely monitored utilizing an alternating schedule of contrast-CT and PET scans.</p>

<section id="current-medical-situation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-medical-situation">Current medical situation</h2>
<p>Two weeks ago Sam’s regular blood work confirmed that his liver numbers were continuing to drop. This allowed us to continue to test if his new immune system would be effective, on its own, to battle the cancer. Sam was off all immune system suppressants for just over three weeks (May 15 - June 6). However, bloodwork at the Prince George clinic showed that liver inflammation was starting again. This past Friday Sam started on a lower dose of immune suppressant in an attempt to find a balance of allowing the immune system to do its work while protecting his liver.</p>
<p>Currently, we are near the end of this wait-and-see period with a PET scan scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The earlier improved liver enzyme numbers, coupled with the results of the previous CT scan, also meant that we had what the medical team considered a safe window of time to return home! On May 29 we checked out of the Ronald McDonald House and made the drive back to Prince George! It was an amazing break!</p>

<section id="living-life" class="level2">

<p>I can’t express how good it was to get back home – to be in our own space, and to connect with some of our Prince George friends and family (though not near enough time to see everyone). We spent the first couple of days at my parents home where it was great to see them and for Sam to be reunited with Buddy. After a couple of days our own home was ready to return to.</p>
<p>During this break it was most encouraging for me to simply watch our boy! He loved being home and jumped full into life there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam loved connecting with friends.</li>
<li>He chose to jump right back into school despite having missed the last third of grade 9 and almost all of grade 10. Many thanks to the staff and students at <a href="https://cedars.bc.ca">Cedars</a> who welcomed Sam back in and allowed him to engage with his academics.</li>
<li>He pushed hard to catch up on a couple topics often spending 2-3 hours a day on homework. … Honestly he had seemed to have more energy than I did.</li>
<li>This last Friday, after writing a three hour math test during the day, Sam even attended the school dance. His muscles are still sore from having had a great time with friends and dancing the evening away!</li>
</ul>
<p>Tina and I were able to connect with various friends. So good to see you and we look forward to our next return!</p>

<section id="upcoming" class="level2">

<p>We are now back at the RMH having finished our latest drive down yesterday. Tomorrow morning Sam will have a PET Scan at the BC Cancer clinic. Preliminary results may be available in clinic that afternoon though the full report may have to wait until Friday. Results of this scan will dictate next steps. If the results are positive then we can proceed with our preferred treatment option: to simply keep doing what we have been doing over the last number of weeks – let the immune system do its work and wait-and-see. If results are more challenging we will discuss options with the team here at BC Children’s.</p>

<p>The last two weeks have been a whirlwind. Key highlights included: attending game 5 of the Vancouver versus Edmonton series, a CT Scan, and regular bloodwork, a new bike for Colin, some family visits, and all the regular clinic check-ins.</p>
<section id="current-medical-situation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-medical-situation">Current medical situation</h2>
<p>Over the last two months we have been most concerned about getting Sam’s liver inflammation under control. There have been various medicines used in this. The meds likely helped, but perhaps what was also needed was simply time. Sam’s liver numbers have settled into a safe range and he is now off all immune suppression medications. This is great as, for the first time, his new immune system is able to fight the cancer without the influence of other medications.</p>
<p>The challenge is knowing if relying on Sam’s new immune system will be enough – will it be effective? In an attempt to answer that, last week Sam had a contrast CT of his chest, one week of being off immune suppression, and he will be scheduled for additional CT scans in the weeks ahead. He will also continue with regular PET scans to ensure that the cancer has not moved to new locations in his body. The great news is that there has been no detectable significant change in the size of the cancerous mass<sup>1</sup>. The last known change in the disease centre was between Feb.&nbsp;14 and April 5.</p>
<p>For Sam the downside of being off immunosuppression is that symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) have started to return. However, he knows that these pains most likely mean that the cancer is also being fought. I don’t know if it will stick but our current motto is:</p>
<div class="center">
<p><em>Bring on the pain, kill the cancer, live life!!</em></p>
</div>
<p>To sum-up the current situation – Sam is now in a wait-and-see period. Our hope is that his immune system will, at minimum, hold the cancer back, and at best remove it. We are thrilled that it seems the cancer has not progressed. We are hopeful that the current plan could finally work. We also fear that the cancer will change and develop again. So now we wait and we try to live life with, and in spite of cancer.</p>
<p>Moving forward we will continue with Sam’s regular bloodwork and every few weeks complete further scans (CT and/or PET scans).</p>

<section id="current-medical-picture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-medical-picture">Current medical picture</h2>
<p>This past Wednesday Sam had his most recent PET scan. Scan days are always stressful. Our experience with this type of stress is not unique. Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at minimum the day leading up to them are intense. It is weird because the scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is happening. They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that we fear. To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for. This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.</p>
<p>The results of this last scan, like many others, has mixed news.</p>
<section id="cancer-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cancer-status">Cancer status</h3>
<p>The good news is that since Feb 5<sup>th</sup> there are no new disease sites.</p>
<p>The difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam’s chest remains and has grown a small amount. The previous scan, April 5, showed no detectable change at that site and so to have this new growth strongly suggests that the cancer is active there. Options for treatment are limited and it is unknown if they will be effective.</p>
</section>
<section id="liver-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="liver-status">Liver status</h3>
<p>The previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active site in Sam’s liver could be cancer. This has been ruled out via biopsy. We have known for sometime that Sam’s liver has been stressed due to side-effects of his immune therapy treatment causing his immune system to become deregulated. Latest metrics of Sam’s liver health have been improving. Recent ultrasound of the liver shows a minor increase in size. The Doctors want to continue monitoring this mass as it is not an urgent priority right now.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>We are in a hard place with two potential options for treatment – it is not known which is best or if either will be effective.</p>
<section id="option-1-rely-on-the-new-immune-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-1-rely-on-the-new-immune-system">Option 1: Rely on the new immune system</h3>
<p>Sam’s new immune system is fairly well established (although not completely until about one year after the bone marrow transplant). To date we have not had the opportunity to see what it can do. The previous treatments had side-effects that required steroids to calm/ suppress his immune system so that permanent liver damage could be avoided. If he was taken off the immunosupressants and just let his own (new) immune system work, this option would allow Sam to live and enjoy his life without medications and risk of side-effects. However, we do not know if his new immune system will effectively battle the cancer.</p>
<!-- and there is no way of
measuring effectiveness in a timely manner (ie. cannot have another PET
scan for 6 weeks, and that is too much time to risk the cancer growing).-->
</section>
<section id="option-2-resume-immune-therapy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-2-resume-immune-therapy">Option 2: Resume immune therapy</h3>
<p>This option would require the use of Nivomulab (an immune therapy drug) again. We know that this drug can make the cancer in Sam’s body ‘visible’ to the immune system. However, this is also the drug that resulted in Sam’s liver being inflamed and the subsequent need for steroids to calm the immune system (Catch-22). If we go this route, the team would use the lessons learned from last time to modify their therapy plan in an attempt to limit side-effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>If side-effects can be avoided, this will likely be the more effective treatment.</li>
<li>If side-effects cannot be avoided, this treatment could cause permanent harm (eg. the risk of liver failure).</li>
</ul>

<section id="life-together" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="life-together">Life together</h2>
<p>Despite all of the challenges and the ongoing threat to Sam’s life, we have been able to enjoy life as a family. The cancer aside, Sam is healthy, regaining weight, growing, and getting stronger.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks we have been instituting Sam’s <em>foodie-rehab</em> plan. This is where we walk from RMH to the small mall at Oak and King Edward. Once there, Sam has been enjoying most items at Kim’s Express (Vietnamese food). One evening Sam led our family for a larger walk, one that I did not know he was capable of, down to Cambie Village about 1.5kms away. We had some great ice cream before walking back. This was an epic evening for our family.</p>
<p>Over this past weekend we were able to join some of the Frickers and the Townsend side of the family to experience the animals at Aldor Farms near Ft. Langley. I loved watching Sam take some time to groom Rob, a huge Percheron work horse.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we celebrated Mothers Day. Ronald McDonald House put on a beautiful brunch. In the evening, we took in the Canucks vs.&nbsp;Oilers hockey game (which Sam mostly slept through due to being tired from his big farm day Saturday).</p>

sent funds to assist us in this journey. This extra funding is allowing
us to simply live and enjoy life, meals, and activities together without

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}
::: -->
<p>It has been ten days since we returned to Vancouver. Life has been fairly routine, even slow. We have we been checking in with the hospital clinic and so far the metrics associated with Sam’s liver numbers are going the right direction. This suggests that the liver is healing/ becoming less inflamed.</p>
<p>This week we have a few items on the agenda: a) Clinic check-ins; b) Ultrasound of the liver to verify that the non-cancerous mass there is either stable or improving; and c) PET scan (possibly). The PET scan is the big item as it will show us the status of the cancer in Sam’s body. Results of the PET will also strongly inform Sam’s next treatment(s).</p>
<p>This journey has been long and we are tired. This past weekend family facilitated giving me a break. Tina and Sam stayed with Mary and the Fricker family (Tina’s sister’s family) giving me almost 24 hours off. It was great to have that time without responsibilities.</p>
<p>Sam remains positive and continues to get stronger. Tina and I are glad to see this. However, we cannot escape feelings of needing-to-be-vigilant and anxiousness about what could be happening undetected – the results of the PET scan this week will be very helpful.</p>

<p>It has been a whirlwind trip back home. We connected with more people than we expected and yet missed too many of you. I hope you can forgive us if you were missed – we really have more love than we had time. Three days in the city was not enough but we were glad for it! It was also incredible to re-connect, even if just in-part, with the community that has been supporting us.</p>
<section id="travel-log" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="travel-log">Travel log</h2>
<p>The initial idea to travel was presented last Wednesday, April 17. However, actual travel plans were dependent on metrics on Sam’s bloodwork that would allow the medical team to decide if it would be safe for Sam to travel. Specifically, if Sam’s numbers were not good on the Friday, we check again on the Monday, and if they were not good then the trip would be cancelled. So to keep things flexible we chose to drive. As a family we have always done road trips and Sam was looking forward to this pilgrimage drive home.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-1-travel">Day 1 – Travel</h3>
<p><em>Sunday, April 21</em></p>
<p>We got away from Vancouver at a good time. It was a cool cloudy day with some showers heading into the Fraser Canyon. We had a great early lunch at Horsting’s Farm near Cache Creek. In the afternoon we stopped to see Renee near Williams Lake. Refreshed and fed we travelled on arriving at my parents as the sun was setting.</p>
<p>We received a loving welcome from Mom and Dad and all of us loved seeing Sam reconnect with Buddy – his dog was crazy excited to see him! We were also able to catch the last two periods of the first Vancouver vs. Nashville playoff game.</p>

<p>It has taken me <del>three</del> four days to write this post. Sam has had such great energy lately. He has been waking up at the same time as me and we have spent our days together – talking, playing, reading, and even sharing the chores.</p>
<p>In the early morning just over a year ago, on April 18, 2023, Sam arrived at BC Children’s hospital. Oh, how far he as come along this incredible journey of seeing him return to health. He is by no means out-of-the-woods yet, but now he can “walk-in-the-woods” with us. Sam is joyful, he has increasing energy and stamina, and his courageous attitude seems to have no limits.</p>
<p>One year ago Tina and Sam had been sent down by air ambulance and were admitted directly to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). I arrived about twelve hours later. Sam remained in PICU for the next number of days while the medical team stabilized him, and initial imaging and biopsies were completed. It would be 10 days later that the biopsy reports were completed and Sam’s cancer was identified. Once identified, we knew we would be travelling a challenging road – one that was not mapped by any procedures or protocols that the medical team could follow.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="celebration-despite-ambiguity">Celebration despite ambiguity</h2>
<p>There is so much unknown. We know that Sam’s cancer remains. It is unknown if the treatments he has ongoing will be wholly effective.</p>
<p>Despite this ambiguity we celebrate! Currently, Sam is doing well. The last PET scan on April 5<sup>th</sup> suggests that Sam’s cancer has been stable! The central mass remains but has not grown and the immune system has been actively working there. The three disease centres found earlier have been neutralized.</p>
<p>More than the state of the cancer, we celebrate that Sam is feeling good! He is gaining strength. He is active and enjoying life!</p>
<p>There is much work to be done but for the time being it seems we are winning – I pray that this is true and continues to be true.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="major-milestones">Major Milestones</h2>
<p>What a journey this has been. Sam has been through three eras of cancer treatment: 1) chemotherapy, 2) BMT, and now 3) immune therapy. Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy. Below is provided a quick review of the major milestones.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We celebrate that a year following the start of treatment, Sam is feeling the best he has ever felt. We are incredibly grateful.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>The newest growth in Sam’s liver is not the original cancer though it will be monitored.</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing immune therapy has de-regulated Sam’s immune system. Side effects are becoming dangerous as Sam’s liver is inflamed. In order to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam’s immune system needs to be brought back to a regulated state.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to the medical team here at <a href="http://www.bcchildrens.ca">BC Childrens’ Hospital</a> who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care. The <a href="https://rmhbc.ca">Ronald McDonald House (RMH)</a> has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the <a href="https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca">Westwood Church</a> office.</p></li>
<li><p>We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.</p></li>

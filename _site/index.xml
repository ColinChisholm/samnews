  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>It is the morning of day 111 and we have crossed mid-way of the treatment plan. Saturday was the fifth and final day of chemo-drug delivery for this round. That afternoon we left the hospital, returning to the Ronald McDonald House. It felt good to get away from the hospital and find the quiet of our room here, but it has been hard.</p>
<p>The truth of it is this journey is hard, long and hard. Sam has been amazing, a few days ago, day 2 and 3 of this treatment, he was the brightest and most active I have seen him in months: playing games, seeking social connections, including making a new friend.</p>
<p>In general, we were all expecting this round to be easier. From the past experience this set of drugs did not hit as hard. However, by day 4 Sam was lethargic and had intense brain-fog. Now that we are out of the hospital we are catching up on sleep, The fog seems to be lifting, but nausea and pain need to be managed constantly. Generally, Sam just feels gross.</p>
<p>Sam longs for normal days and our return to normal life – we all do. I fear I do not remember what normal is or how to find it. This cancer-storm is swirling around us – it is difficult to see beyond it.</p>

  <title>Friends and the beginning of round 4</title>

<p>I think this has been the longest gap between posts. My silence is has simply been a break and waiting.</p>
<p>This morning I am writing from Sam’s hospital room, as yesterday Sam began round 4 of chemotherapy, and as per the plan he will be in the hospital for five days of drug delivery. We did have a delay over the last week as we needed to wait for his body to recover from round 3.</p>
<p>It had been a quiet week until this past weekend when we were encouraged by the love of friends and family. Unplanned, we had several visits almost back to back. So good to see you all!!</p>
<section id="recent-visits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recent-visits">Recent visits</h2>
<p>We had many great talks, some special activities, games, an ice cream run, and a couple bike rides. Sam was encouraged to see his friends and family – though he did not get to engage with the activities as much as his energy was low.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jess and Kate B. took Tina to Bard on the Beach and the Symphony of Fire (fireworks). Back at the RMH I visited with John Sr.&nbsp;and Sam with his classmate John (jr.).</p></li>
<li><p>A surprise visit with Auntie Shannon and Uncle Kevin. We knew Kevin was going to be here but they surprised us with a visit with Tina’s sister.</p></li>
<li><p>Brian, Beth, David, and Luke H. were here. The boys and Sam hung out while</p></li>
<li><p>I was able to have a quick quality visit with Mike J.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all of you! Your presence, your words, your friendship have encouraged us!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am thrilled for Tina as she will be leaving us for a few days to attend Marielle’s bridal shower (engaged to Kurtis F.). How will Tina do away from us? How will we do with out her?</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for the support of friends and family.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps it was the quieter week that gave us space to realize how tired we are. Recent visits have lifted us but we are definitely feeling this marathon.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful to keep going with the start of round 4. Each round bring us closer to the end of this journey.</p></li>
<li><p>The medical team here is great. Returning to the hospital is fairly easy. Many of the nurses know us and welcomed us back. Sam knows the routine and there is a comfort in the familiarity of it.</p></li>
<li><p>We hope that there will not be a need for the contingency plan (<a href="../../posts/2307/2023-07-17_contigency-plan.html">bone marrow transplant</a>), yet we need to prepare ourselves for it, and all the additional experiences and time that it may bring with it.</p></li>

<p>Sam has completed round 3 of his chemotherapy. This marks half way through the current treatment plan. However, we are delayed in starting round 4. With each round of chemo Sam’s immune system is knocked back and metrics monitoring this drop to zero. Before he is able to start the next round his body needs to recover. This time the recovery is slow… so we wait. With low levels Sam is also low energy and life has been fairly quiet.</p>

<p>Sam is nearing the end of round 3 which will mark the half-way through this treatment regime. Generally, it has been slow and quiet week with trips back and forth to the clinic but there has been much anticipation in our minds for the arrival of my parents and Sam’s dog Buddy this past Friday.</p>
<p>For each of the clinic visits Sam’s energy was low, walking down the hall took significant effort, so we transported back and forth him by wheel chair. Thursday afternoon we were in to check levels to prepare for Friday’s LP<sup>1</sup>. Friday was a long day in the clinic: Platelets first, then the LP, and Hemoglobin provided in the afternoon.</p>
<p>With the completion of clinic procedures and a couple units of new blood Sam was ready to go. We packed up and made our way to Ft. Langley for a great reunion! Sam has been having great visits with my parents and Buddy these last couple days. So good for him, for all of us, to experience some normal life!</p>

  <title>Contingency planning</title>

<p>Sam had a clinic appointment this past Friday and honestly I had to let that conversation sit for a number of days before presenting it here. It was a really important conversation, one that I very much appreciated as the team is being proactive in Sam’s treatment. Despite this, I received it like a gut-punch.</p>
<p>What it came down to is making a contingency plan. Sam’s cancer is unknown and as such it is impossible to know if the current treatment will be fully effective. If it is not, then what next? We discussed the possibility of following the current treatment up with a bone marrow transplant. There is quite a lot of planning needed to move forward with a such a procedure as a donor needs to be found. So we are starting now.</p>
<p>The bone marrow transplant treatment, if needed, would start following the current treatment (~early Oct), and would add some significant time to our stay down here.</p>
<p>If it is needed, of course we will do it. We just hope that it is not needed.</p>

<p>This past weekend has been very quiet. As a family we managed one outing on Friday night to visit Uncle Kev. The remainder of our days have at RMH and for the most part in our room here. Sam is mid-way through this cycle of chemotherapy and as expected his blood counts are falling. This means that his energy levels are low, and that his immune system is compromised. The best thing we can do is keep him from getting sick – hide away until his system starts recovering.</p>
<section id="hospital-er-visit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hospital-er-visit">Hospital ER visit</h3>
<p>Last night we paid a visit to the ER. Sam was having chest pain and headaches that would come in waves. The medical team pursued the potential for a blood embolus (throwing a clot) ordering ECGs, bloodwork, and a CT. After a few hours these pains subsided, and the tests were all clear. So a bit of a mystery but good that there was nothing serious.</p>

  <title>Round 3 out-patient life</title>

<p>There have been too many new-normals over the last number of years. Covid and post-covid transitions being the most obvious in our collective consciousness. It seems that we are finding another new-normal here as patterns of life are established. At the 3-4 week scale we have the pattern of hospital in-patient period of ~5 days (drug-delivery) followed by out-patient life.</p>
<p>Out patient life is where life begins to feel most normal, with meals, and activities. I am still amazed that activities are possible and that we have seen such a good return of Sam’s health. This week we had some unexpected encounters that brought some home-normality to life.</p>

  <title>Round 3 hospital time and release</title>

<p>We are now all back at the RMH. These last few days Sam was in hospital to receive the chemical delivery of ths current round of chemotherapy. All-in-all this round seems to be going well. Sam has such a great understanding of the process and because of that he asked to get his drugs pushed a little earlier each day. He had a goal in mind and with the assistance of the medical team he was able to achieve it. It was a simple goal – <em>Get out on Saturday</em>. And that is exactly what we did… it was a little late but it was worth it. We left the hospital a little before midnight and had a good sleep – without interruptions.</p>

<p>Clinic day and start of round 3 of chemo.</p>
</dd>
<dt>July 5 - 8</dt>
<dd>
<p>Days in hospital for chemo drug delivery. Sam received a variety of different drugs. Generally, he had anywhere from two to four lines of medication including additional hydration running the whole time we were in hospital. The additional hydration was to ensure that his body not only received the chemicals but was able to process them without damaging his liver or kidneys. The inconvenience of hydration is that Sam was up every ~2.5 hours (day and night; I was up with him).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Nana was here and had great visits. Tina and her mom spent the much of their time at the RMH with visits to Sam. On the Friday Cal, Tricia, and Jane visited as well. Nana returned home on Saturday.</p>

<dt>Sunday, July 9</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our first full day out. So far the only side effect that Sam has felt is fatigue but even this fatigue is better then his best days from a couple months ago. Kevin was able to come by and we hosted him with a BBQ here.</p>

  <title>Treatment progress and the start of round 3</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Sam’s clinic appointment went as expected yesterday: bloodwork confirmed that his body was ready to start round 3. We were also able to discuss results of last week’s PET scan and lumbar puncture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Last Thursday Sam had a lumbar puncture. A small amount of spinal fluid was removed and an equal amount of chemo-drugs was inserted. Analysis of the spinal fluid confirmed that there is no cancer in the central nervous system!</p></li>
<li><p>PET scan results – the treatment is working! Sam has two main cancerous masses one in his chest, and a smaller one in his neck. Results from the PET scan indicate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both masses are smaller then in the previous scan</li>
<li>The activity level of the cancer in the body is reduced</li>
<li>No new locations of cancer have been detected (i.e.&nbsp;it has not moved to other locations in the body)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Sam is receiving additional monitoring (i.e.&nbsp;more scans) then normal because his case is … not a normal cancer case. Since so little is known about this form of cancer additional monitoring is taking place. I expect this is for two purposes. First to confirm that the treatment is working. Second, to document that the treatment is working – adding to the pool of knowledge on cancer.</em></p>
<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<p>The next number of days will be here at the hospital while Sam receives his treatment. I will be with him through the nights. Tina and her mom will join us through the day. Tina and I may even get away for some additional time together while Nana visits.</p>
<p>This round of chemo includes some nastier drugs, though Sam is in a much stronger place then the last time he experienced them. Potential side effects are likely to include pain, nausea, GI sores, and further hair loss.</p>

<p>This past weekend was spent like many of yours – celebrating Canada Day.</p>
<p>Sam’s day-to-day health is much improved. To look at him, other than the thin short hair, your might no know there was anything wrong. Since my last post:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tina and I celebrated our 27<sup>th</sup> anniversary! We celebrated as a family out for a great meal and then ice cream.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam had his lumbar puncture and PET scan – results are pending.</p></li>
<li><p>Nana (Tina’s mom) arrived – she will be here for the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrated Canada Day in North Delta where Kevin and Kelsey F. were the MCs for the activities there.</p></li>
<li><p>Townsend reunion with Tina, her mom, her siblings and most of their families – four generations.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<p>Tomorrow Sam returns to the hospital. We will check in at the day-clinic where:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We will hear the results of this past weeks scans.</p></li>
<li><p>Check blood levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Start round 3 (i.e.&nbsp;begin delivery of chemotherapy drugs) – assuming blood levels are where they need to be.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming all goes as planned Sam will be admitted tomorrow evening for a total of five days of chemo-drug delivery.</p>

  <title>Round 2 complete and some family fun</title>

<p>Chemo round 2 officially ended on the weekend and it has felt like a great success. Aside from 4 nights during the initial chemical delivery days and several clinic days, Sam spent the remainder of the time out of hospital. The majority of the days have been within the hospital campus, and over the last week we were able to spread our wings a little further as Sam’s immune system strengthened.</p>
<p>Though the lived experience of this round felt better, tests this week will determine what the unseen impacts were on the cancer. Sam will have a lumbar puncture and a PET scan over the next few days.</p>
<p>Next week Sam will return for some hospital days to begin round 3 of chemotherapy which, given it’s chemical makeup, may be harder on him then this last round.</p>

<p>This past weekend we have had good time as a family and with the extended family.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We were able to celebrate little Jayme’s birthday. Though Auntie Tricia and Uncle Cal also took the chance to spoil our boy – providing him a huge steak, which he enjoyed immensely.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncle Kevin started his new position in Delta and so we have been able to connect with them more. We spent an afternoon with Kevin and Kaden at Granville Island. Over the last few years Sam, Tina and I have made it there a number of times and have our favourite spots for snacks.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you do if your immune system is low and you want to go to the movies. The drive-in is a great option. The three of us had a great night taking in a double header … though we paid for it the following day.</p></li>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Over a month ago one of our nurses told us that Sam would become an out-patient. At the time it seemed impossible. We were in the middle of round one, Sam was weak and sick, but it seems we have arrived at out-patient status. This morning marks day 19 of this round of chemotherapy – Sam has made it through the chemo-valley without the need of hospital time (his numbers are starting to recover). What a difference!</p>
<p>It is really weird as it seems we stumbled our way into this out-patient status. With the exception of four nights, when Sam received the chemo-chemicals, he has been out of the hospital for this round. Sam has had clinic appointments twice a week, and at each one we half-expected that he may need to be admitted. We know now that, even with dropping blood levels, if Sam keeps feeling good there was no need to return to the hospital. Living on the hospital campus makes out-patient life feasible as in the event Sam got sick (e.g.&nbsp;due to his chemo-compromised immune) we would simply visit the ER here and follow the oncology patient protocols.</p>
<section id="looking-back" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>The week as been a quiet one. Sam was in the valley where his blood levels were lowest. Yet his time there was dramatically better then last time. His energy levels were low and given that his immune system was at its weakest point he hid out for much of the week. A few highlights from this past week:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Playing cards with Minecraft with Sam</p></li>
<li><p>Slurpee-run therapy walks – the local corner store is about six blocks away. Sam is getting closer to walking all of the way there.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple outings for Tina and I. Including a bike ride to Kerrisdale.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>The week ahead will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continued recovery from this last round of chemo</p></li>
<li><p>Tests to monitor the state of the cancer in Sam’s body – to confirm it is still being reduced and that we can continue without having to adjust the treatment regime.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concerns-and-victories">Concerns and victories</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Thankful that it Sam has made it through the second round of chemo as an out-patient.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for the Ronald McDonald House, all the generosity supporting it, and all the volunteers serving here. This place makes living through this journey … almost feel like normal life.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, one of our greatest challenges is that we have been away for over two months and it hard to stay connected with home. We miss you. We are thankful that Sam has been able to connect with friends on-line. We are thankful for visits and notes. However, despite these interactions, the nature of this cancer journey can feel isolating – for all of us.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that we are getting to know some families here.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that Sam has made it through round two!</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that the treatment is working. There is also concern that it is effective to remove the cancer fully.</p></li>

  <title>A second weekend at the RMH</title>

<p>I am not writing as often as, simply, there is not as much to say. Our days are normal<em>ish</em> – a good thing! Currently, we are not trying to understand what is happening, or what is next. It is good to have the stress level come down and have some time for mental recovery.</p>
<section id="the-last-couple-days" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-last-couple-days">The last couple days</h2>
<p>This weekend has been at the Ronald McDonald House (RMH) – our home away from home. On Saturday my parents got into town. It has been great to share meals and visit with them. A few quick highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Card games. Including Sam’s ongoing winning streak in crib. … I will attempt to humble him, if I can, in the week ahead.</li>
<li>A walk and ice cream. We continue to be encouraged with how Sam’s strength is returning.<br>
</li>
<li>A coffee date with Tina while Sam visited with his grandparents.</li>
<li>Father’s Day BBQ hosted by the RMH.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="upcoming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming">Upcoming</h2>
<p>Tomorrow, June 20, we will have a fourth clinic appointment to evaluate how Sam’s blood-levels are doing and if his immune system is holding.</p>
</section>
<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concerns-and-victories">Concerns and victories</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Thankful for normal<em>ish</em> days.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for time with my parents.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we are thankful that Sam is not feeling the effects of this chemotherapy round. The pending valley-of-gross appears to be getting smaller and smaller. Of course there is some concern as Sam’s blood levels continue to drop. Some days in hospital are still expected.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful that the treatment is working. There is also concern that it is effective to remove the cancer fully.</p></li>

<p>Wow!</p>
<p>It is currently sixty days since we started this journey, and day twelve of the current/ 2<sup>nd</sup> round of chemotherapy. Today is also marks 7 days of not being in the hospital!</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Cheng has told us a number of times that we need to remain flexible on this journey as each round of chemo is different. There are different sets of chemotherapy drugs in each round. With each round Sam is also different. Starting this round Sam has had a amazing return of his health as compared with the first. A few points to compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam’s lungs and heart are clear of fluids</li>
<li>The cancerous mass has been reduced in size and density</li>
<li>Our boy has his appetite back</li>
<li>Sam is gaining his physical strength back</li>
</ul>
<p>I thank God. I thank all of you for your care. I thank the medical team for all their great work.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-last-couple-days">The last couple days</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Thursday, June 15</dt>
<dd>
<p>A relaxed day at the RMH. The simple and normal things of life: chores, meals, playing cards, strumming a guitar. Sam and I started playing crib again.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the afternoon, Cal T. paid us a visit. We had a great talks and Sam had a new challenger for crib. Yes, Sam beat both Cal and I.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Friday, June 16</dt>
<dd>
<p>We had an appointment at the oncology-day-clinic. Checked Sam’s blood levels, cleaning and dressing changes for Sam’s central-line. The lab is fast – blood levels were back levels are dropping, but again they are still above any levels of concern.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>I clarified with the doctor, wondering if it was possible to skip the valley caused by chemotherapy. As I understand it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The valley will come. Sam’s immune system will collapse to zero (as indicated by the ANC<sup>1</sup> metric). … Yes, I have created a graph for this.</li>
<li>Be flexible, each round of chemo is different. Some rounds the valley is short. Some the valley is long. Be flexible, as it is not possible to know.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the afternoon, we had a great visits Chris and Jane, and David C. We all took Dave to the airport, and based on Hunter’s recommendation from over a month ago we shared a meal at the Fairmont – delicious!</p>
<p>The evening was a shock. Tina and I were not ready for this. Sam, energized by a great meal was not done. As many of you know, Tina often starts to come alive as the sun gets low. So we were off to the [Richmond Night Market](https://richmondnightmarket.com). We spent over two hours exploring the booths. Sam loved it! Tina loved it!</p>
<p>We are all stunned by how well Sam is doing!</p>

<p>This morning I am writing from our room at the RMH – because we are all still here!</p>
<p>Two days ago Sam went in for his clinic appointment. We had expected that he would be admitted, as his blood counts would be falling. But we received great news! Although his counts had dropped they had not dropped as to cause any concern. The result is we got a bonus 72 hours away from hospital admission. Sam has a clinic appointment tomorrow am – likley he will need to be admitted then.</p>

<p>Following the clinic appointment in the morning we had relaxed afternoon at the Ronald McDonald House. I got out for a bike ride. Margaret and Daniel joined us for the evening. It warmed my heart to see the cousins chatting together!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wednesday, June 14</dt>

<p>I drove Margaret and Daniel to the airport using our van (my sister drove the van down and then flew home). In the afternoon, the three of had a good time playing family games. Of note: <em>Connect 4</em> the card game is far better than the original.

<p>It has been a few days since I have provided an update. The pace of everything is changing – for the good. No longer is everyday a new experience, or sitting in expectation of some procedure. The pace has slowed and life has become somewhat more predictable.</p>
<p>Sam is currently on day 8 of his second round of chemotherapy. The medical team really wants to maximize his time away from the hospital so, given that he was doing well having received all the medications on Saturday morning, they discharged him for the weekend! The plan is that he goes back into the hospital before his blood counts drop too low and his immune system becomes compromised.</p>
<p>This morning we will go to the hospital to get his blood levels tested and either be admitted for be sent back out for 48 hours.</p>
<section id="reflections-on" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on">Reflections on …</h2>
<p>We have had a great weekend. Here is a quick recap:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Friday, June 9</dt>
<dd>
<p>Was in hospital – receiving doses of chemotherapy. In the evening the most of the Fricker family here. Sam had a good visit with these cousins whom he had not seen since before all of this started.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Saturday, June 10</dt>
<dd>
<p>The morning was at the hospital for a final dose of chemo drugs for this round of therapy. In the afternoon we were out to the Ronald McDonald House.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sunday, June 11</dt>
<dd>
<p>The beauty of not being in the hospital is that there are no interruptions! Sam and Tina both slept in until mid-morning. At about the same time my sister Margaret and cousin Daniel arrived! We had a great brunch and visit with them!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Monday, June 12</dt>
<dd>
<p>Similar to Sunday, we had another slow day. Margaret and Daniel spent some good time with us simply hanging out at the RMH. The five of us also managed a short outing to grab ice at the Dairy Queen on Main St.&nbsp;Sam is also getting to know another young man here. J. was diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks after Sam – I expect we will be connecting with him and his family over the weeks ahead.</p>

  <title>What does a round of chemo look like? An overview</title>
  <dc:creator>Colin C.</dc:creator>
  <link>http://samc-news.netlify.app/posts/2023-06-08_chemo-overview.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>We are back at BC Children’s Hospital, once again receiving the amazing care that this place provides. Sam has just started his second round of chemotherapy. Today I thought I would provide a brief sketch of what Sam’s chemotherapy looks like – there is no one method for chemotherapy, rather plans are tailored to each circumstance. As such, though there may be some similarities with other chemotherapies this is Sam’s – and really it is the only one that I can speak to.</p>
<p>Considering chemotherapy in days and weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>A round of chemotherapy is 21 days long.</li>
<li>The first five days are intensly chemical. Numerous does of various chemotherapy specific drugs, along with drugs to help Sam not feel sick from receiving the prior are delivered. These days Sam is attached to the IV pole and has anywhere from 2-5 lines delivering chemical treatment to him via his central line (Hickman CVC<sup>1</sup>).</li>
<li>The following ~10 days are the valley, the chemicals take effect and life gets gross. Chemotherapy is intense. It hammers actively growing cells, in hammers your immune system. The benefit is that it hammers the caner the hardest. Over this time:
<ul>
<li>Blood counts will drop and there may be need for transfusions.</li>
<li>Sam’s immune system will be entirely wiped out leaving him with no defences and secondary infections are a risk.</li>
<li>In addition, he will likely experience some level of mucositis where sores can develop in the mouth and possibly anywhere in the GI<sup>2</sup> system.</li>
<li>Drugs during this phase are generally for pain and nausea control with additional drugs, as needed, for secondary infection management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The final days of the treatment are when we expect to see Sam’s body recover from treatment with a return to normal blood counts and life starts to feel better again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following a round of chemotherapy Sam, well all of us, will get a few days of a break … before starting this pattern all over again.</p>
<p>This is written on day 4 of 21. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> round of treatment – a day or two before we start into the valley.</p>
<section id="reflections-on-june-7-and-8" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-june-7-and-8">Reflections on June 7 and 8</h2>
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup> was our first full day back at the hospital and day 2 of this round chemotherapy. There were many visits by the various members of the medical team – making it feel like a day of interruptions, but this is the work of getting well.</p>
<p>Nurses trained me how to change Sam’s dressing – a clear bandage protecting his central line. Even now, when home seems so far away, they are preparing us to be there. Maybe it is weird but I enjoyed this – taking on a new challenge and also caring for my boy.</p>
<p>V., Sam’s physiotherapist, is thrilled with how improved he is, and the strength that he is regaining. She has provided additional tools to keep him moving – a stationary bike, and the next day some resistance bands and weights.</p>
<p>The next morning was more routine filled with various drug deliveries and fluids testing. In the afternoon: Tina and I got away, stocked her up on food that she can eat, after we returned, we had a good visit with Cal and Tricia.</p>

<li><p>Thankful for the team here at BC Childrens’s Hospital. For their expertise, the hard work that they do, and also the personal care they invest.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for the care of friends and family. Many thanks to for encouraging notes received through this site, email, and FaceBook.<br>

<li><p>Concern as we head into the valley and life for Sam will feel gross (mucositis/GI sores, nausea…).</p></li>
<li><p>Concern that the cancer will be fully removed and that it will continue to respond to the treatment.</p></li>

  <title>Results and the return for round 2</title>

<p>Once again I am writing from Sam’s bedside here at BC Children’s Hospital – our second arrival. Compared with the first, this is so much easier. Sam’s health has dramatically improved and it is much easier to be in hospital when you plan to go there. We are also returning to people that know and care for Sam.</p>
<section id="reflections-on-june-7" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-june-7">Reflections on June 7</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a business day. Sam’s return to the hospital. We checked into the Oncology day-clinic, Sam had a few tests, we met with Dr.&nbsp;Cheng to discuss the progress made and the plans moving forward. In the afternoon Sam would receive his first chemical doses of chemo round 2<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<section id="results" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h3>
<p>We had an opportunity to look at before and after imagery from Sam’s PET scans. I am glad I had not seen the first scans until now. The difference is dramatic.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The size and density to the cancerous mass is greatly reduced</li>
<li>The impacts on Sam’s other organs has been removed – or is minimal. The first scans showed high impacts on Sam’s lungs heart – mostly causing high levels of fluid build up and pressure. Now his lungs are now clear of fluid and only a residual amount of fluid remains around the heart – this is expected to resolve over time. 3. Currently Sam has two main masses of cancer. The main one in his chest and a smaller one in his neck. They are greatly reduced since our arrival seven weeks ago. I need to get a copy of the results again so I can quantify the amount of reduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is exciting – the cancer is responding to treatment.</p>
</section>
<section id="plans" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>It is exciting to see such progress. In moments of weakness it is also terrifying. The remains a lot of work to be done these cancerous masses are measurable in centimetres – there are billions of cancerous cells to be removed<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, for the first time we actually have a plan! Until now, none of us have known what the plan would be. Sam’s cancer is extremely rare, and how it would respond to treatment was not known. Now that we know the treatment is working. We will move forward with a treatment regime. The plan is to complete six rounds of chemotherapy with on-going evaluation to adapt the plan as needed.</p>

<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concerns-and-victories">Concerns and victories</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We are thankful for positive results and that Sam is doing so well.</p></li>
<li><p>We are thankful for a plan, though we need to gear ourselves for a marathon. We have heard it said around here numerous times that this cancer journey is both a roller-coaster and a marathon.</p></li>
<li><p>Concern that the cancer will be fully removed and that it will continue to respond to the treatment.</p></li>

<p>Our break away from the hospital comes to an end today, yet we can bask in the joy that this weekend provided! We have had an incredible weekend as a family and with some of our extended family. It was amazing to see how well Sam is doing. I don’t know if the cancer i gone – but I do know that it has been dramatically reduced.</p>

<section id="june-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="june-3">June 3</h3>
<p>Our first full day off. A day of rest and simply exploring the RMH (Ronald McDonald House). We also took care of all the medical items ourselves – medications and needles and NG tube feeding. We had it all down all the steps were going well – until we hit a glitch. We do not have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while in the hospital: The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it back. After working at it for about an hour we decided togive up for the night and pushed as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a hack that sometimes works to dissolve clogs).</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon<sup>1</sup>, we had a wonderful visit with Bob and Wendy H. Sam shocked me as he was also up for the visit. Wendy and Tina had a good catch-up, while Bob, Sam, and played on a digital game table. Sam and Bob broke the game after Sam discovered a glitch and they both exploited it.</p>
</section>
<section id="june-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="june-4">June 4</h3>
<p>Sunday morning the NG remained clogged. We were fairly quick to recognize that this was a blessing! Sam had a new job – to eat and ensure that he met or exceeded the calories that he would have received via the NG tube. He did not disappoint –our boy has his appetite back. About mid-afternoon, Tina pulled the tube.</p>
<p>Also in the afternoon we had some great visits. First with Uncle Kevin and then joined by cousins Chris and Jane (Cal’s children). We all chatted and hung out outside. That evening the cousins and the three of us got Sam off hospital property for the first time since this whole journey began! We got out for a meal – at the Kerrisdale White Spot where Sam had a milkshake and a double-double.</p>
</section>
<section id="june-5" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="june-5">June 5</h3>
<p>Another great day as a family starting with a full breakfast provided by volunteers at the RMH. Times talking together, imagining, drawing – including time outside (outside can be precious following weeks of being in hospital). In the afternoon we grabbed an ride-share down the Marine Gateway Cineplex and took in the new Guardians o the Galaxy movie – loved it!</p>
<p>These last few days have felt like a vacation!</p>

<li><p>Bonus physiotherapy for Sam. The elevator at the RMH was under repair for most of the weekend. This initially forced Sam to take the stairs – two flights up to the room. By the end of the weekend he chose the stairs to keep restoring his strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Today we will learn the results of last Friday’s PET and CT scans – the current state of the cancer.<br>
We will discuss with the medical team what the next steps are. Once again we will be stepping into the unknown. For now we know what life looks like until mid-day.</p></li>

  <title>Freedom from hospital life</title>

<p>Good morning!<br>
Here we are having a good morning as we are experience a good level of freedom. All three of us are currently at the Ronald McDonald House. This am, Sam and I have had breakfast together, and as I write this Tina is sleeping in.</p>
<p>Sam made it through, we made it through this last round of chemotherapy!</p>
<section id="reflections-on-june-1-and-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-june-1-and-2">Reflections on June 1 and 2</h2>
<p><em>June 1</em> Sam was still in hospital. In consultation with the medical team most all of Sam’s meds moved from a) being on a delivery schedule to list as take-as-needed, b) changed from IV delivery to oral. The purpose of this day was to prepare us to get out – to give us control of Sam’s care.</p>
<p><em>June 2</em>, yesterday, was very full with procedures and our transition out of the hospital. Forty-five days prior we made the emergency move from Prince George to the hospital. We have lived there full time and now we had the day to prepare to leave.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The day started with trip to the BC Cancer Clinic for a PET and CT scan. This was much easier than the last trip. Last time the Ambulance service transported Sam which was needed given the state of his health at that time. This time, the three of us went downstairs, got in a taxi, and walked into the clinic.</p></li>
<li><p>Next were the steps to leave including:</p></li>
<li><p>A trip to the pharmacy – to collect all of Sam’s medications. This was actually simple, as the pharmacy is just downstairs. I would realize hours later, well after closing that I bought the wrong needles for Sam’s blood thinner…</p></li>
<li><p>Trips to move our lives over to the RMH<sup>1</sup>. In our time here we have lived full-time at the hospital with minor respite at the RMD. During our time here we have only added materials to our lives as we bought or people brought us life-essentials, and gifts arrived. We are blessed to have all that we need and more. I did spend a couple hours moving our things – very glad that the RMD had utility wagon that we could borrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Trip to the Red Cross – to get some hardware for Sam. He has some strength to regain so in moments of weakness or fatigue he can fall back to the wheelchair or shower-transfer-bench.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We were fully here by 7:00pm. We are loving it! The feelings this morning are almost reminiscent of family vacations that we have had in the past. We are not home but we are free to be ourselves!</p>
</section>
<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">

<li><p>Upcoming we have to return to the hospital on Tuesday, June 6 when we will hear the results of the PET and CT scans and likely be admitted to start the next round of chemotherapy.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful, for the amazing care Sam received at BC Children’s Also thankful that we have a break from it – that we can sleep through the night without the need to take vitals, take blood, deliver medications, or listen to alarms.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges of side-effects have mostly resolved! I will need to go in search of a vacuum cleaner as Sam’s hair rains from his head.</p></li>
<li><p>Concern, a recent scan flagged a the potential for a problematic kidney stone.</p></li>

  <title>A weekend pass, friends, and a date!</title>

<p>Today is day 44 in hospital. Aside from one afternoon weeks ago Sam has not left these halls – it is time to have a change of scenery. Expectations are that this will happen over this weekend! As I write this my family is sleeping and I am only listening to the sound of a single pump pushing supplemental food into Sam’s body. No other lines are attached to him and no alarms were ringing through the night!</p>
<section id="reflections-on-may-31" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-may-31">Reflections on May 31</h2>
<p>Yesterday the medical team started preparing to have us leave for a few days! We will be out in the small gap of time between chemotherapy rounds. All of Sam’s medications were converted to oral and I was trained up on how to use the food pump which the team wants to keep going. We are excited to have a change of scenery, to get Sam out, and for all three of us to have comfortable beds (<em>we will be staying at the RMH – Ronald McDonald House</em>). Honestly, we also have a little anxiety to make this change and leave the safety of these four wall. But bring it on – let’s get out for a few days!</p>
<p>Aria and family were able to visit again. Aria and Tina hit up a local gluten free bakery. Sam was able to have a short visit with David and Lucas H. and a little longer with David. We are thankful for their friendship.</p>
<p>In the evening Tina and I attended a concert! For several years Tina was been dreaming of attending a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3sDbKMebVH2VYcRSl7u1VC?si=6FcIxJJtS6uwiBK8RLl0qA">For King and Country</a> concert and we were able to get tickets. Tina loved it! She also loved huge hugs from Carlene and Kendra S., and Kim P. who happened to be sitting fairly close by!</p>
</section>
<section id="concerns-and-victories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concerns-and-victories">Concerns and victories</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Thankful for the upcoming opportunity to get out for a few days. Round 3 of chemo will likely start next Tuesday. There will be adjustments as we take on a new routine.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for the chance to visit with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful for date nights!</p></li>
<li><p>Thankful to see Sam’s blood counts returning to normal including the numbers indicating the strengthening of hi immune system.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges of side-effects continue. Sam, although have a return of energy, is becoming physically exhausted. This whole regime, and being bed-bound for a full week, has led to parts of his system being bound – constipation is significant issue. It will pass but likely not without pain. GI sores from the chemotherapy also complicate this.</p></li>
<li><p>Concern, a recent scan flagged a the potential for a problematic kidney stone.</p></li>
<li><p>Upcoming, this Friday June 2, Sam is books for a PET scans. The purpose of this scan is to determine the current state of the cancer. We look forward to knowing the results. We are excited that previous scans suggest significant reductions in the cancer, and that this scan should confirm that. As always, we will remain concerned about any cancer in his system.</p></li>

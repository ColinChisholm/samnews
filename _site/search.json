Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.\n\n\n\nThoughts and questions\nMark places the gospel in the context of prophecy – something that Isreal has been waiting for. This initial reference, from Isaiah 40:3, highlights the role of John the Baptist. I think it is clear that people were aware of and wanting forgiveness of sins.\nThis passage raises a question for me. How can John’s baptism be for the forgiveness of sins, if only God can forgive sins? How is Jesus’ message and his forgiveness different?\n\n\nPrayer\nLord, please help me be aware of my sins, to confess, repent, and change. Jesus thank you for your forgiveness."

Even now, when home seems so far away, they are preparing us to be there. Maybe it is weird but I enjoyed this – taking on a new challenge and also caring for my boy.\nV., Sam’s physiotherapist, is thrilled with how improved he is, and the strength that he is regaining. She has provided additional tools to keep him moving – a stationary bike, and the next day some resistance bands and weights.\nThe next morning was more routine filled with various drug deliveries and fluids testing. In the afternoon: Tina and I got away to stock her up on food that she can eat, after we returned, we had a good visit with Cal and Tricia."

He knows it will be tough but he also knows that it has an end. It is hard to see him carry all of this. He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together. Top of mind:\n\nWe are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam. We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process. One option is to just receive blood but the better option is to receive marrow. The latter, receiving marrow, is far better for Sam but involves a intense procedure for the donor.\nSide effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects.\nThe medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. That all the pieces fall into place for the best timing possible.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement – they really do bolster us.\nWe are thankful for Sam’s school who are looking forward to his return and who are willing to work with us once Sam is able. We are thankful for his classmates who wrote him and sent him gifts.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR (short version)\nYesterday: surgery for tissue samples followed by pain management. In the weeks to come, Sam will be here at BC Children Hospital as he is treated for what is assumed to be lymphoma.\n--\n\n\nFull version\nHi all,\nYesterday was a big day for Sam. He had the surgery to complete a series of biopsies. These included the removal of a lymph node at the base of his neck, a lumbar puncture, a bone marrow sample from the top of his hip, and establishing a PICC (described here) to facilitate ongoing blood work and upcoming intravenous drug delivery. All the procedures went well. Dr. Webber, completed the lymph node removal and said it went “Perfectly”. This was all done before noon. The biggest challenge of the day has been pain management, but Sam has been a trooper.\nThe staff here continue to be amazing, always taking the time to answer any of Sam’s questions, and making complex biology and bio-chemistry understandable. It is honestly amazing to hear Sam explain his disease to others – he gets it, understands it, and given the situation is very glad to be here.\nNext steps are not totally clear. We are working with the understanding/assumption that Sam has lymphoma (one possibility described here) As of April 23, we still do not know what type of cancer this is. The signs all point that way (e.g. X-ray and CT scan), but this will not be totally confirmed until the tissue samples are processed. Here is what we are currently expecting:\n\nSam will start a round of drug treatment, as soon as later today, and specific treatments will be refined following the analysis of his tissue samples\nSam is currently in the ICU, and we expect him to be here for the next number of days after which, he will be transferred to the oncology unit just a few floors above where he will remain a patient for three weeks or so (timing of stay will all depend on tests).\nTina and I will be able to check into the Ronald McDonald House here on hospital campus on Sunday. This will give us a home base, we will also be able to continue staying in the room with Sam.\n\nMany thanks to all of Sam’s friends and teachers, and all of our friends and family. We love to hear from you. We may not get back to you right away but know your messages are encouraging to us. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will try to answer them either directly or in a following update.\n\n\nQ&A\n\nHow is Tina doing?\n\nShe is actually great. She has been working so hard advocating for Sam’s health over the last months, trying to get the bottom of why he has been sick. Now, she can relax as Sam is where he needs to be, receiving the medical care that he needs. She also loves the medical world, she is in her element here. Our biggest challenge for Tina will be to ensure she is properly fed, especially given her dietary restrictions. We will need to find a new normal here.\n\nHow can we help / Let us know if we can help.\n\nHearing from you is currently the best. As noted, we might not be able to get back to you right away, but all of your notes are encouraging. Tina and I have literally had tears-of-joy reading them.\n\n\nThanks again for your prayers and support,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR\nWe are in a waiting period, and as results from Sam’s biopsies trickle in, we have some knowledge of what the disease is not. Our hearts are peaceful and we have been filled with messages of love and prayer from around the world!\n\n\nReflections on April 21, 2023\nHow long have we been here? As I write this, it is only the beginning of day four and I am writing about day 3, so much has happened.\nYesterday, was … a beautiful day. Sam was far more comfortable, being another day away from his biopsy surgery. It was wonderful to watch him sleep and nap on and off through the day. This time of rest also powered him up to visit with family. It was also great to see Tina catch up on some much-needed sleep.\n\nPhysical Health\nMedically, it was generally a quiet day. No new tests, just the routine of checking vitals, checking blood chemistry, and taking medicines (e.g. pain management from the previous surgery). We are in waiting phase. The lab has not finished processing the tissue samples taken April 20th. Despite not knowing much yet the medical team continues to communicate. The best news was that we now know that the disease is:\n\nnot in the central nervous system\nnot in his bone marrow.\n\nIt might be a quiet weekend as lab results may not come back until mid-next week. So we wait as a family, and the medical team waits with us. One might think this is frustrating, but it is not, rather it is a peaceful and strategic waiting. Once the tests come back the doctors will be very intentional on how to manage Sam’s health. So we wait, for the right understanding, and the subsequent right treatment plan.\n\n\nSoul Health\nWow, what a good day! We have heard from so many friends, family, some of whom we have not connected with for years, but this challenging time is pulling our people together. Thank you for reaching out to us, conveying your care, telling us your stories, or simply what is happening in your world. We are supported by your words, your love, and your prayers.\nPeople around the world are praying – it’s awesome. Friends, family, and their friends and families, bible study and prayer groups; from Prince George, across the province, across the continent, and as far away as Zambia!\nWe have also had some amazing face-to-face visits/care.\n\nA friend anticipated our needs and showed up with a bag of groceries and goodies picked especially for Tina and her dietary needs / requirements.\nA providential visit with the Schellenbergs with whom we have shared so much life and adventure. What are the chances that they just happened to be in the area this weekend! For those who don’t know them, they live in Saskatchewan.\nSam had a great visit with his cousin Chris, Uncle Cal, and Auntie Tricia.\n\nTo wrap up this post, please know that we feel cared for in soul and body. Although we do not know what treatment for Sam will look like, we are in a peaceful place. That might change, we may have challenges ahead, but we are bolstered by your love, we are carried.\nLove to you all!\nColin"

    "text": "Reflections of April 23, 2023\nYesterday was a quiet day with challenges.\n\nCancer, but what type are we dealing with?\nYesterday morning, Tina and I spoke with Dr. Chang who has been taking the lead in Sam’s case. I was really glad to have this conversation, to know what Dr. Chang was thinking, and strategies going forward … but this one also hurt. The major challenge for the medical team is that they still do not know exactly what they are dealing with. This is a cancer, but the specific type of cancer remains unknown.\nGiven that there are unknowns around the type of cancer, there are also unknowns about how it will behave and potentially where it is. Sam needs to have a full-body scan, if an opening in the schedule at the BC Cancer Clinic can be found, and timing on this is essential. The scan needs to happen before treatment starts and the team can only wait so long (i.e. treatment needs to start this week).\n\n\nOn needles\nOver the last month, Sam has not had a good time with needles. Really, I think we can all relate – getting a shot, or having blood taken, is not something any of us enjoy. Sam has taken them on, with blood test after blood test. To make things worse, as Sam entered the hospital system he had to have IV medications, many of which failed. In the last nine IVs he experienced six failed attempts, and three were initially established successful; of those one was accidentally pulled during surgery, one blew, and a last one remains. All this to say needles cause a level of anxiety.\nSam has had a number of days of grace. The PICC line provides easy access, but last night it stopped working, they could not draw blood. If it does not work, then drawing blood via needles will be needed. In a few texts last night, we asked for prayer for this.\n\n\nVictories and comforts\n\nThe small things really do matter! Many thanks to our nurse Pam who made sure that Sam was able to get into the shower today. He came out clean, refreshed, and feeling human!\nI didn’t finish the needle story:\n\nThe doctor changes the order regarding taking blood. So no need for blood last night!\nThis morning I came into the room at 4:45 and both Sam and Tina were full of joy. Sam had just had his blood taken, and no needles were used. The PICC line was working again.\n\nSo where was I coming in from at 5:00am? We now have a home away from home at the Ronald McDonald House, where I had a comfortable, and mostly full night’s sleep.\n\n\n\nNeeds and concerns\nCurrently:\n\nFirm diagnosis of the type of cancer. This will significantly inform treatment.\nPET scan to determine where this disease is and where it is not. Timing is essential on this – the sooner the better.\nThat Sam’s PICC line would continue to function. Ideally, that it could also be used for treatment … either adjustments are needed or another PICC will need to be established as the current one is not ‘centrally located’ (not exactly where they need it to be)."

Needless to say, life has been intense.\nIt is amazing the range of emotion that can happen as your child sleeps. Over this last week I have watch with joy and contentment as Sam slept peacefully, to another extreme filled with waves of fear and anxiety that he hasn’t woken up (yesterday). In the later afternoon yesterday, we stepped away from Sam’s bedside, where he continued to sleep, to visit with Cal and Tricia. My day was made when we got back, he was not only awake, but he was up and out of bed, sitting in a chair. This was sweet joy, relief, and peace.

This is something that is essential for now, though not sustainable… we are stressed and exhausted.\n\nMy parents, Earle and Dorothy, are here with us. Great to have their support. Thanks to the many who are also supporting them.\nRecent scans confirm where the cancer is. No new surprises, though the impact of the cancer on Sam is stronger than previously known.\nCancer diagnosis is still pending. It is expected that BC Cancer Clinic will be able to identify the disease.\nHowever, we may not be able to wait. Initial treatment steps may need to be taken before the diagnosis is in. From the medical perspective this is about managing risk. Starting treatment without diagnosis may impact longer term effectiveness of the treatments; not starting could allow the cancer to impact Sam in the now."

I managed to get some sleep over at the Ronald McDonald House and came back to Sam’s room for 5:00 (these days that is sleeping in for me). Shortly after I got here Sam woke up. Despite the intensity of the previous day, despite the pains in his body, he was full of faith and joy. He celebrated that his PICC worked for the latest blood-work (currently running at every four hours). We chatted for a bit, I rubbed his back, wrapped him in a warm blanket, and then tucked him back in. Currently he is sleeping soundly."

    "text": "Reflections on April 28\nThis date will be significant to use for the rest of our lives – that day we received a diagnosis and the initiation of treatment.\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nIn the morning the lead care team (Oncologist, Clinical Care Nurse, and Social Worker) met with us – the three of us to start, and then Tina and I for the details. Finally we have a diagnosis, Sam’s cancer has been identified. We have been looking forward to this as a diagnosis leads to a plan … if you know what it is, you can know how to treat it. We all wish it was that simple.\nSam has an extremely rare form of cancer. It is a blood-based cancer mostly located in the lymphatic system. The name of the disease is almost as long as the first two sentences in this paragraph. We know what to call it, we know where it is, the team will treat it. However, the treatment plan will be week-to-week, and as treatment phases are completed, additional steps will be taken to evaluate the response/impact on the disease.\nPhase 1 of treatment has started, a round of chemotherapy, and we know the plan for this week.\nI have to add that Sam is a champ! Today’s needle count tallied to 4 including the addition a new IV line.\n\n\nSurrounded by love\n\nMy Mom and Dad were here and were have to have a good time talking with Sam while Tina and I met with the medical team. I am glad they were here. It was good to share tears with them.\nRhoda and Dave, had a great conversation with Sam, and gifted him with comics and games\nTina had a great call with sister.\nMany thanks to all of you for your notes of support, well-wishes, and prayers! Your words, stories, encouragement, and solidarity with us are amazing.\n\n\n\nNeeds, concerns and victories\n\nWe are all walking in the dark. Our family and the Drs. Pray for wisdom to simply see the next step.\nWe need to see the cancer respond to the treatment. It is unknown, how this cancer will respond, or how it may adapt/ resist.\nChemotherapy, is intense, and some of the chemicals are literally poison. We have entered a world of trade-offs. The disease must die, but the treatment has dangers and significant potential side-effects.\n\nWe will count the small victories and joys\n\nSam took on numerous pokes/needles like a champ.\nSam’s PICC worked … most of the time.\nOut of bed. Sam’ has been sick and mostly bed-ridden. He enjoyed some time out of bed sitting up in a chair.\nIt was a puppy therapy day today. If you know Sam you know he loves dogs.\n\n\n\nMeditation\nThere are two passages of scripture that are constantly in my mind. Two passages that reflect in-part where I am at.\n\nHe guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; Psalm 23\n\n\nif you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” “ ‘If you can’?”said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” Mark 9:14f"

As I reflect on the day, I am shocked at the contrast to the shock and challenges of the days prior. Yesterday was filled with many victories.\n\nWe haven’t seen Sam have energy like this in over well over a month.\nTimes sitting up.\n\nConcentrations levels to\n\nGreat visits and conversations with guests including: Shalom, a friend from PG; and his cousins Amanda, Chris and Mary-Joy.\nConquer Mario Kart tracks\nTake in NHL playoffs\nRead comic books\n\nHe was hungry, and the cousins brought Wendy’s\n\n\n\nHealth and healing victories\n\nSam’s PICC continues to function. This is a big deal. Blood chemistry is every four hours, and without the PICC it would mean needles for every sample. Today, needles to draw blood were not necessary.\nOn needles. Sam gets a small injection every 12 hours. Our nursing team might be in competition to see who can deliver with the least pain. Of the last three needles Sam felt one, a bit; didn’t feel one at all; and was tickled by a third. Wow, if we can keep this pattern going that would be amazing. Happy for what we have now.\nSam was able to complete the intake of his intense chemotherapy chemicals. If you have ever been in the health care system for more than a couple days you likely know the importance of … movements. Alex, Sam’s nurse, literally danced for joy as this health moment. The timing of this was critical to allow for the taking of the drugs. Also, if it had taken any longer Sam might have needed a yet another new IV."

We got out of the room, taking a tour of the ward, and checking out the youth room where we discovered options for art, music, a library of games (digital and board), movies, and video games. We made plans to start a Harry Potter movie marathon.\nSam was hungry again and I biked down to Broadway to grab a pizza (a great outing for me). It is weird, but life felt … normal. Our normal, now includes regular check-ins with nurses and doctors who are doing their routines of checking vitals, taking blood, loading Sam’s supplemental feeding, adjusting oxygen… this is normal? this is routine? Yes, it seems to be… and it was all going well until it wasn’t.\nIt is amazing how one tiny little thing can mess up your routine Something jammed up Sam’s NG-tube1. Attempts to clear it resulted in spillage and literally hours of frustration and extra work by the nurses. Sam has been patient through most all of it, and lost some significant time for sleeping… it is still not cleared."

I can’t remember the last time Sam ate so well! Sam also noted that it is much easier to eat without the tube in. The medical team is also happy about this latest development.\nActivity levels are also coming up. Sam is able to walk around some more. He was able to walk the hall here and he spent an hour sitting up and talking with his Uncle Cal.\nThese recent changes certainly give us hope for the future and definitely joy in the here-and-now. We are grateful for all of this. We have been cautioned that these improvements can be expected, but that the only way to evaluate if the cancer is responding is to complete new scans to see what has happened to the tumors. We will continue to choose hope and take joy in each victory.\nGoing forward, the next days ahead should be routine with medicines, bloodwork, checking vitals, and a new addition of prescribed physiotherapy. In about a week Sam will go for imaging and then the next steps will be determined."

    "text": "Clarifying, from what I understand\nIt really has been encouraging to see Sam come back, the return of his humor, his appetite, desires to do things. This morning, I want to explain my understanding of what has been happening with him. Before arriving, Sam was very sick, having extreme lethargy, and barely able to get out of bed. His body’s immune system was on overdrive in effort to battle what we now know is the cancer. The effect of this was that his whole body inflamed – think of a time that you had a small cut or burn and your skin was red and a little puffy around the injury… now take that idea and apply it to inside Sam’s body, and the majority of the lymphatic system. So why is he so much better now? Why does the treatment seem to be working so well? Is Sam healing?\nTreatment started this past Friday, six days ago, and by the end of Saturday Sam was already feeling much better. This is actually an expected response. I am unclear if how dramatic the response is was expected, but the medical team did expect a fairly rapid response. One of the drugs that is part of Sam chemotherapy prednisone, which can be used to change the way the body ’s immune system reacts – effectively taking the immune system out of overdrive and reducing all that internal swelling.\nSo is Sam getting better? Sam is definitely feeling better and has a much improved quality of life, and I hope and pray that he is getting better in the long term. However, I need to be clear, when it comes to the cancer in his body, we just do not know.\nSam is now scheduled for a scan tomorrow morning. We will know more once those results are in."

The bulk of the day\n\nTo start Sam did go under general anesthetic to adjust his PICC-line and complete a lumbar puncture. The PICC procedure did not go the way the medical team had hoped. The plan was simply to adjust the position of the existing line, but they were not able to do this so they pulled that line and attempted a new line on the other arm. This new line also did not go as planned, as they were not able to centrally locate the outlet. This is where there is some concern, attempts to (re)position the previous or locate the current line failed due to blood clots in Sam’s system. No one is very clear as to why he has clots so frequently in his blood vessels (to be clear this is not because they are keeping anything from us … it is just they do not know). We know that some of the clots are an effect of the cancer – as the body tried to fight it; alternately, this clotting could be somehow related to the previous chemotherapy. The fact is there is clotting in Sam’s blood vessels, and there is more clotting than a couple weeks ago despite taking blood thinners twice a day.\nThe lumbar puncture went as planned.\nThe quiet afternoon turned into an additional procedure. The previous scans had focused on the upper chest and neck. This ultrasound was done to evaluate the potential of clotting in the abdomen and legs. Results are pending.\n\nWe were finally back to the room by about 4pm. Time for dinner. I had left overs. A friend had brought poke bowls yesterday and the left over one as almost as good as the first. Sam had a hospital dinner supplemented with snacks from Safeway. Tina was off on her own adventure.\nI am so happy for Tina as she was able to get away yesterday afternoon. Senga was here and she took her out to a local park and then out for a Tina-friendly meal."

I even had a couple hours on my own. My brother-in-law has lent me his electric bike and I went exploring the great network of bike lanes through numerous neighbourhoods across Vancouver (17km ride). This trip included some stops to pick up essential supplies including a stop at a gluten-free bakery for Tina.\nThe level of care continues to be amazing. Sam had a headache in the afternoon and given that the he does have some blood clots the doctors have reason to monitor this as a concern and ordered an MRI which he received hours later. Sam definitely has his humor back stating to the doctor that we will set your mind at ease by looking at my mind.\nAs a family we had a relaxing evening. We walked out to the deck where Sam and I played a hive pocket. Sam destroyed me the first time we played but I managed a win yesterday – though my brain hurt. A solid strategy game that does not take that long to play."

Sam cam through the surgery to establish the new central line without any difficulty – though a little tender where he opened up. The new central line working as expected, this line (aka Hickman device) was established travelling from Sam’s leg through to the major vessels just below his heart. The previous PICC lines were not able to reach the major vessels near the heart as there was too much clotting in Sam’s chest. With this new line established round two of chemotherapy has begun.\nChemotherapy medications were started promptly after Sam returned from surgery and a short period in recovery. All of these medications are entering his system through the central line system along with a lot of additional fluid. As I have noted in previous posts the drugs are intense and in order to protect his other organs additional fluid is needed. Practically speaking this means that life, and sleep are interrupted with many bathroom breaks.\nGram and Papa were here providing moral and practical support. We also had a visit from Lisa S. who brought a stack of cards from home with messages of encouragement from Sam’s friends at the Westwood Church’s youth group, along with cards for Tina and I."

Over this past weekend Sam has had a lot of intense ‘medicines’ pushed into him. I put this in quotes as if we weren’t tackling cancer these medicines would be considered poisons. Along with the medication has been a lot of fluid – resulting in the need to put a lot of fluid out.

    "text": "Reflections on May 16 and 17\nYesterday morning, as I was considering what to convey, the day started with a challenge… I will get to that, but before I do I actually need to back up two days.\nTwo days ago we had a meeting with our medical team. It was a fairly standard check-in but one that shook Tina and I to the core. We were both, individually, in own personal funks for much of the day before we had an opportunity to discuss it together. During the meeting we were introduced to members of the medical team from Canuck Place. They let us know some of the services that they provide including potential future options respite from the hospital experience. What shook us to the core was the main purpose of Canuck Place – palliative care. To be clear, we are not going down that road, but not knowing what the future holds, it is within the realm of possibility and I suspect that the medical team here had a ethical obligation to ensure this connection was made. We have known this, but the meeting forced us to confront the possibility more directly – again, re-opening this wound/fear.\nTwo days ago was also the fifth of five days of the heavy chemical delivery for this current round of chemotherapy. The remaining 16 days of this chemo round are in place for the chemicals to complete their work, and to allow Sam to recover from it. As of that evening we had not seen much for side effects. Yesterday morning, that would change.\nYesterday, as I was considering what to write, Sam’s day began with a strong wave of nausea and pain. The previous two nights one of the drugs that Sam was given was Cytarabine. I’ll blame that one, though it could been side effects from the whole set. It took several hours to get Sam comfortable, and by the afternoon he was feeling ok, tired but ok. And, though I am exhausted as well, Sam’s fatigue is beyond the lack of sleep we have been having as is a product of the treatment the chemo. In addition the chemotherapy medications will reduce Sam’s blood counts – reducing the capacity of his blood to: provide him energy/oxygen (hemoglobin/ red blood cells), protect him from injury (platelets), and protect him from disease (white blood cells).\nSome positive highlights:\n\nTina and Erin S. were able to spend some time together (2 days ago)\nA relaxed and enjoyable visit with Uncle Cal and cousin Jane (yesterday)\nCoffee and treats sent to by friends."

I expect that Sam’s mouth will be more sensitive as sores develop, these sores could extend all they way through his digestive track. Chemo-balding is also expected.\nPotential for secondary infection: One of the effects of the chemotherapy is a reduction in Sam’s blood counts. The medical team can manage reductions in red cells and platelets, but they cannot manage reduced white cell counts. As such, Sam will be more susceptible to colds, flus, or whatever is floating around. We will likely move to a mask-up and wash-up protocol before entering the room.\nUltimately, that this intense treatment is effective at removing the cancer from Sam’s body."

We were excited to receive update pictures from Joel and Joanna C. as they travelled from Prince George with Sam’s good friends Chase and Ben C. Ben of course brought greetings from his family and Sam and I are now set up with our favourite cookies from Krista. We had an initial visit Saturday evening and despite a having to cancel a morning visit on Sunday the boys had great visits again in the afternoon.\nAn expected side effect from the chemotherapy was a drop in Sam’s blood counts. We saw this over the weekend with a full collapse of Sam’s white count on Sunday. This temporary loss of the body’s ability to fight was also paired with a fever and phlegm. The medical team was ready for this and had Sam on antibiotics right away. Visits were cancelled for most of the day as Tina and I watched our boy sleep most of the day away. By later afternoon, Sam was awake and was welcomed visits from Chase and Ben – though masks were needed for all. So good to see these boy / young men back together again – Good for the soul (ours and Sam’s)!"

In our meeting, she told us about Sam’s latest chest X-ray – the purpose of which was to rule out the potential for pneumonia related to Sam’s cold. There was also enough information in the image that Dr. Cheng could provide a preliminary report: the tumour is smaller than shown in the previous CT scan (taken after round 1 of chemo). We are headed in the right direction – round 1 saw a reduction in the cancerous mass, and round 2 appears to be doing the same! We will know better in with the next scan in a couple weeks when a scan will be done to image the cancer itself.\nAs to what the next steps will be following this round of chemo – that is simply unknown."

The heavy chemical part of the treatment is over and now Sam’s body has to work through the effects. Effects include (these are generally expected):\n\ncollapse of the immune system: Sam’s blood counts are monitored daily. Over the last number of days drops in the red and platelet cells have been managed with transfusions. We need to simply wait for the white cells to come back. It seems Sam may be through the worst of this part as cell counts are beginning to return on their own.\nsores in the GI system. Sam had some sores in his mouth earlier in this process. They have healed but he has other much further on in the system that are painful. These will heal in time.\nMost of Sam’s time is spent in bed … his body is doing a lot of work. The downside of being in bed this long is that he is stiff and sore; he has a lot of muscle tension and very little energy to stretch it out or move to loosen it up. We will get there but there is work to be done.\n\n\nNext steps and current state of the cancer:\n\nThe truth is the next steps are very much unknown. The treatment plan will depend on how the cancer has responded to this latest round of therapy.\nWe are encouraged, Sam had an X-ray to rule out that the flu he had was not causing a pneumonia. This scan confirmed that he did not have pneumonia. What was unexpected, is that the scan also gave us a glimpse at the state of his cancer, and the doctors confirmed that the cancer-mass has shrunk.\nOnce this current therapy is complete on June 2nd Sam will be booked for a scan. Once the results of the scan are known a new plan will be made."

In consultation with the medical team most all of Sam’s meds moved from a) being on a delivery schedule to list as take-as-needed, b) changed from IV delivery to oral. The purpose of this day was to prepare us to get out – to give us control of Sam’s care.\nJune 2, yesterday, was very full with procedures and our transition out of the hospital. Forty-five days prior we made the emergency move from Prince George to the hospital. We have lived there full time and now we had the day to prepare to leave.\n\nThe day started with trip to the BC Cancer Clinic for a PET and CT scan. This was much easier than the last trip. Last time the Ambulance service transported Sam which was needed given the state of his health at that time. This time, the three of us went downstairs, got in a taxi, and walked into the clinic.\nNext were the steps to leave including:\nA trip to the pharmacy – to collect all of Sam’s medications. This was actually simple, as the pharmacy is just downstairs. I would realize hours later, well after closing that I bought the wrong needles for Sam’s blood thinner…\nTrips to move our lives over to the RMH1. In our time here we have lived full-time at the hospital with minor respite at the RMD. During our time here we have only added materials to our lives as we bought or people brought us life-essentials, and gifts arrived. We are blessed to have all that we need and more. I did spend a couple hours moving our things – very glad that the RMD had utility wagon that we could borrow.\nTrip to the Red Cross – to get some hardware for Sam. He has some strength to regain so in moments of weakness or fatigue he can fall back to the wheelchair or shower-transfer-bench.\n\nWe were fully here by 7:00pm. We are loving it! The feelings this morning are almost reminiscent of family vacations that we have had in the past. We are not home but we are free to be ourselves!"

    "text": "Reflections on this past weekend\n\nJune 3\nOur first full day off. A day of rest and simply exploring the RMH (Ronald McDonald House). We also took care of all the medical items ourselves – medications and needles and NG tube feeding. We had it all down all the steps were going well – until we hit a glitch. We do not have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while in the hospital: The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it back. After working at it for about an hour we decided togive up for the night and pushed as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a hack that sometimes works to dissolve clogs).\nSaturday afternoon1, we had a wonderful visit with Bob and Wendy H. Sam shocked me as he was also up for the visit. Wendy and Tina had a good catch-up, while Bob, Sam, and played on a digital game table. Sam and Bob broke the game after Sam discovered a glitch and they both exploited it.\n\n\nJune 4\nSunday morning the NG remained clogged. We were fairly quick to recognize that this was a blessing! Sam had a new job – to eat and ensure that he met or exceeded the calories that he would have received via the NG tube. He did not disappoint –our boy has his appetite back. About mid-afternoon, Tina pulled the tube.\nAlso in the afternoon we had some great visits. First with Uncle Kevin and then joined by cousins Chris and Jane (Cal’s children). We all chatted and hung out outside. That evening the cousins and the three of us got Sam off hospital property for the first time since this whole journey began! We got out for a meal – at the Kerrisdale White Spot where Sam had a milkshake and a double-double.\n\n\nJune 5\nAnother great day as a family starting with a full breakfast provided by volunteers at the RMH. Times talking together, imagining, drawing – including time outside (outside can be precious following weeks of being in hospital). In the afternoon we grabbed an ride-share down the Marine Gateway Cineplex and took in the new Guardians o the Galaxy movie – loved it!\nThese last few days have felt like a vacation!"

    "text": "Reflections on June 7\nYesterday was a business day. Sam’s return to the hospital. We checked into the Oncology day-clinic, Sam had a few tests, we met with Dr. Cheng to discuss the progress made and the plans moving forward. In the afternoon Sam would receive his first chemical doses of chemo round 21.\n\nResults\nWe had an opportunity to look at before and after imagery from Sam’s PET scans. I am glad I had not seen the first scans until now. The difference is dramatic.\n\nThe size and density to the cancerous mass is greatly reduced\nThe impacts on Sam’s other organs has been removed – or is minimal. The first scans showed high impacts on Sam’s lungs heart – mostly causing high levels of fluid build up and pressure. Now his lungs are now clear of fluid and only a residual amount of fluid remains around the heart – this is expected to resolve over time. 3. Currently Sam has two main masses of cancer. The main one in his chest and a smaller one in his neck. They are greatly reduced since our arrival seven weeks ago. I need to get a copy of the results again so I can quantify the amount of reduction.\n\nThis is exciting – the cancer is responding to treatment.\n\n\nPlans\nIt is exciting to see such progress. In moments of weakness it is also terrifying. The remains a lot of work to be done these cancerous masses are measurable in centimetres – there are billions of cancerous cells to be removed2.\nDespite the challenges, for the first time we actually have a plan! Until now, none of us have known what the plan would be. Sam’s cancer is extremely rare, and how it would respond to treatment was not known. Now that we know the treatment is working. We will move forward with a treatment regime. The plan is to complete six rounds of chemotherapy with on-going evaluation to adapt the plan as needed."

Today I thought I would provide a brief sketch of what Sam’s chemotherapy looks like – there is no one method for chemotherapy, rather plans are tailored to each circumstance. As such, though there may be some similarities with other chemotherapies this is Sam’s – and really it is the only one that I can speak to.\nConsidering chemotherapy in days and weeks:\nFollowing a round of chemotherapy Sam, well all of us, will get a few days of a break … before starting this pattern all over again.\nThis is written on day 4 of 21. In the 2nd round of treatment – a day or two before we start into the valley."

There were many visits by the various members of the medical team – making it feel like a day of interruptions, but this is the work of getting well.\nNurses trained me how to change Sam’s dressing – a clear bandage protecting his central line. Even now, when home seems so far away, they are preparing us to be there. Maybe it is weird but I enjoyed this – taking on a new challenge and also caring for my boy.\nV., Sam’s physiotherapist, is thrilled with how improved he is, and the strength that he is regaining. She has provided additional tools to keep him moving – a stationary bike, and the next day some resistance bands and weights.\nThe next morning was more routine filled with various drug deliveries and fluids testing. In the afternoon: Tina and I got away, stocked her up on food that she can eat, after we returned, we had a good visit with Cal and Tricia."

No longer is everyday a new experience, or sitting in expectation of some procedure. The pace has slowed and life has become somewhat more predictable.\nSam is currently on day 8 of his second round of chemotherapy. The medical team really wants to maximize his time away from the hospital so, given that he was doing well having received all the medications on Saturday morning, they discharged him for the weekend! The plan is that he goes back into the hospital before his blood counts drop too low and his immune system becomes compromised.\nThis morning we will go to the hospital to get his blood levels tested and either be admitted for be sent back out for 48 hours."

Sam and I started playing crib again.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, Cal T. paid us a visit. We had a great talks and Sam had a new challenger for crib. Yes, Sam beat both Cal and I.\n\nFriday, June 16\n\nWe had an appointment at the oncology-day-clinic. Checked Sam’s blood levels, cleaning and dressing changes for Sam’s central-line. The lab is fast – blood levels were back levels are dropping, but again they are still above any levels of concern.\n\n\nI clarified with the doctor, wondering if it was possible to skip the valley caused by chemotherapy. As I understand it:\n\nThe valley will come. Sam’s immune system will collapse to zero (as indicated by the ANC1 metric). … Yes, I have created a graph for this.\nBe flexible, each round of chemo is different. Some rounds the valley is short. Some the valley is long. Be flexible, as it is not possible to know.\n\nIn the afternoon, we had a great visits Chris and Jane, and David C. We all took Dave to the airport, and based on Hunter’s recommendation from over a month ago we shared a meal at the Fairmont – delicious!\nThe evening was a shock. Tina and I were not ready for this. Sam, energized by a great meal was not done. As many of you know, Tina often starts to come alive as the sun gets low. So we were off to the [Richmond Night Market](https://richmondnightmarket.com). We spent over two hours exploring the booths. Sam loved it! Tina loved it!\nWe are all stunned by how well Sam is doing!"

This morning marks day 19 of this round of chemotherapy – Sam has made it through the chemo-valley without the need of hospital time (his numbers are starting to recover). What a difference!\nIt is really weird as it seems we stumbled our way into this out-patient status. With the exception of four nights, when Sam received the chemo-chemicals, he has been out of the hospital for this round. Sam has had clinic appointments twice a week, and at each one we half-expected that he may need to be admitted. We know now that, even with dropping blood levels, if Sam keeps feeling good there was no need to return to the hospital. Living on the hospital campus makes out-patient life feasible as in the event Sam got sick (e.g. due to his chemo-compromised immune) we would simply visit the ER here and follow the oncology patient protocols."

However, despite these interactions, the nature of this cancer journey can feel isolating – for all of us.\nWe are thankful that we are getting to know some families here.\nWe are thankful that Sam has made it through round two!\nWe are thankful that the treatment is working. There is also concern that it is effective to remove the cancer fully."

We spent an afternoon with Kevin and Kaden at Granville Island. Over the last few years Sam, Tina and I have made it there a number of times and have our favourite spots for snacks.\nWhat do you do if your immune system is low and you want to go to the movies. The drive-in is a great option. The three of us had a great night taking in a double header … though we paid for it the following day."

Generally, he had anywhere from two to four lines of medication including additional hydration running the whole time we were in hospital. The additional hydration was to ensure that his body not only received the chemicals but was able to process them without damaging his liver or kidneys. The inconvenience of hydration is that Sam was up every ~2.5 hours (day and night; I was up with him).\n\n\nNana was here and had great visits. Tina and her mom spent the much of their time at the RMH with visits to Sam. On the Friday Cal, Tricia, and Jane visited as well.

Despite this, I received it like a gut-punch.\nWhat it came down to is making a contingency plan. Sam’s cancer is unknown and as such it is impossible to know if the current treatment will be fully effective. If it is not, then what next? We discussed the possibility of following the current treatment up with a bone marrow transplant. There is quite a lot of planning needed to move forward with a such a procedure as a donor needs to be found. So we are starting now.\nThe bone marrow transplant treatment, if needed, would start following the current treatment (~early Oct), and would add some significant time to our stay down here.\nIf it is needed, of course we will do it. We just hope that it is not needed."

To date, it seemed that each round was getting easier and I had grown to expect that pattern to continue. However, this round turned our expectations up-side-down.\nIt has been a storm. Following our last clinic appointment Sam’s medications were adjusted, and this new medication plan have made things easier. By yesterday, it seems we have his nausea and pain mostly under control and options for when it is not.

We have had to be very strict with the scheduling his medications this round. We have seen decent success in managing his nausea and some success in managing his pain.

Currently, the family is sleeping (Sam, Tina, and Nana)and we don’t have to give any meds for almost two hours.\nVery little new information yet. We have had a couple more conversations, and met another doctor. There are definitely a lot of moving parts happening in the background as the various teams need to coordinate schedules and activities.\nMoving forward I expect the next couple weeks will become busier and busier. On top of the regular clinic check in days there will be lots of tests to complete, and medical teams to meet. The post below still covers the bulk of what we know.\nThis morning, August 26, I am writing from Sam’s hospital room. He is here for the planned delivery of his fifth round of chemotherapy. Sam is sleeping well. I slept ‘ok’ but my mind has been busy as I process the results and recommendations from yesterday.\nYesterday we reviewed the results of the latest PET scan with Sam’s oncologist and clinical nurse. The good news is that the cancerous masses have been reduced further and that there is no new cancer. The challenge is that the rate of reduction in Sam’s cancer will not be enough to see it removed by the end of either this or the next round. We must consider further treatment options.\nFollowing his current treatment Sam will most likely transition to a bone-marrow-transplant treatment protocol. This will involve:\nAmazingly, we already know that there a several good transplant matches for Sam!\nThere will be many meetings upcoming as new plans are made, and as we transfer his care to the bone-marrow transplant team. Although this is hard, I don’t think we would have been satisfied with anything less. This is the best option for Sam and it should provide life-long defense against this cancer."

He still has the strength to walk but not the energy. During these visits Sam’s blood levels are checked as the chemotherapy drugs knock them back, and we need to be sure he does not get knocked back too hard. The results of the tests came back and his hemoglobin and platelet numbers were low enough that he would have to spend an addition three hours in clinic receiving transfusions… but this time was worth it.\nIt is amazing what some additional blood can do. Following the clinic Sam walked most of the way back to the RMH. He took the stairs. He enjoyed dinner. He wanted to wrestle and he spent lots of energy teasing us. … So good to see our Sam be himself!"

Results indicated that we continue to move in the right direction. The cancer was reduced in size and remained in known locations – that is it had not spread anywhere else. However, it was also apparent that the rate of reduction was not enough to remove the cancer by the end of this chemotherapy regime.\nRound six of Sam’s initial chemotherapy treatment is now complete. The PET scan results support the current plan to provide a bone marrow transplant. As the BMT date approaches Sam will have a number of tests to determine his baseline health before starting his bone-marrow-transplant protocol."

In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there … dates and details are likely to change.\n\n\n\nOverview\nThis is the plan as I understand it:\n\nSam has completed the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.\nIn preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam’s health going into BMT.\nBone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is expected to be Nov. 14 .\nFollowing the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0. Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.\n\nDays -22 to -11 (~Oct. 23): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.\nDay -6 and -4: Full body radiation to ensure Sam’s own immune system is completely removed – in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system.\nDays -3 to -1: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam’s own immune system.\nDay zero, currently planned for Nov. 14, Sam should receive the transplant. This is actually quite simple – like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam’s body via his central line.\nDays 0 to 30 Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.\nDays 31 through 90: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Objectives\n\n\nChallenges ahead\nBelow is copied from our Oct. 20st post\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

    "text": "This past week\n\nTreatment\nIt is amazing to me how a short medical appointment can dominate an entire day. Monday through Friday this past week marked Sam’s second and final week of targeted radiation therapy to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. The actual procedure was usually not more than 15 minutes but it would dominate out entire day. Each day we would get ready, load up and head down to the BC Cancer clinic, a short drive away. Tina and Sam would check in while I attempted to find parking – there were a few days where Sam was done before I was able to park the van. Following treatment we would return to the RMH. Sam has generally felt well though with increasing fatigue. His medical team is happy with his current health: He is an otherwise healthy young man, but with cancer.\nWe may never know the full impact that the radiation will have on the cancer. The radiation therapy can take weeks to show measurable impacts but by that point we will be well into the BMT process. I expect next scans to evaluate the various treatments and the state of the cancer will not be feasible until into the new year.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe were able to visit with and be encouraged by some family and friends this past week. Aunt Tricia put on an amazing meal. Uncle Cal paid a visit. Sam was able to have some time hanging out with cousin Kaden, while Tina and I visited with Kevin, Shannon, and Nana. Yesterday John, Jess, Kate, and John Jr. stopped by for a few hours. Tina was able to have and afternoon away visiting with her cousins in Abbotsford."

Today is the last drug delivery day for this current treatment regime. Thanks to our medical team here, by adjusting chemo delivery times a little each day we will get out of the hospital and back to the RMH by mid-afternoon – much better than having to spend another night which is more the standard.\nSam continues to take on this challenge well. He is determined and has made the most of his time here. Specifically, this time, he made choices to simply get out of the hospital room. We spent hours sitting on the terrace/deck and in the family lounge reading and playing cards – I finally beat Sam at crib though I expect this victory will be short lived.\nThe realities of not going home after this treatment, and of not starting school with his friends, are setting in and it is hard. Sam misses home, his friends, and our life there. This is hard for him.\nWe also choose hope and courage. There is a plan and the next steps are laid out ahead of us. We can do this."

    "text": "Last week was hard but beautiful.\nOn Friday Sept. 29 at 11:00am Papa Gord (Tina’s Dad) passed on to eternity. He was surrounded by his family: Mary, Cal & Tricia, Shannon & Kevin, and Tina. Sam and I had to stay here at the RMH but we were also able to have final conversations, express our love, and say our goodbyes with Gord (via FaceTime). The other grandchildren were able to say goodbye via facetime as well.\nMary and Gord have given us an incredible legacy of love and commitment. It is and will be hard losing Gord though it was beautiful to share in the love of the family as they were able to spend a number of days with Gord before the end.\n\n\n\nTuesday – a whirlwind of day.\n\nIt started with a big clinic day including lots of time with Dr. Jacob, the team lead of the BMT team, providing us a review of the process going forward. During this conversation Tina was fielding various communications regarding her dad, that he was in ER in Prince George.\n\n\nGreat news from this day was that there is a bone marrow donor for Sam, and the donor is willing to undergo the bone marrow extraction process. This is great news for Sam’s path of healing.\n\n\nBy mid-afternoon flights were booked and in the evening Tina’s brother Cal and his wife Tricia picked Tina up to head for the airport where they met Tina’s sister Shannon and her husband Kevin – the five of them travelled to Prince George to see Gord. While they were en route Sam and I had a good FaceTime conversation with Papa Gord.\n\nWednesday – Thursday\n\nGord, though responsive, was not going to recover. By the end of day on Wed. he was transferred to Hospice. The siblings and Tina’s mom Mary, spent great quality time with Gord – sharing loving memories.\n\n\nBack at the RMH Sam and I kept going with medication control and connected with the family in Prince George. Mucositis was really bad these days.\n\nFriday\n\nThe family had a few more hours with Gord and at ~11:00am he entered eternity.\n\n\nHere in Vancouver, Sam and I were in clinic, including meetings with different doctors, and a blood transfusion. when we received word about Papa’s passing.\n\nSaturday – Sunday\n\nThe Prince George team made final arrangements for Gord and began their travels back to the lower mainland. Tina got back to us on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\nSaturday night was a rough one for Sam and I. Sam hit the limit on what I was allowed to give him for pain control. Help was just a phone-call away. The on-call oncologist provided me additional pain control instructions and I was so glad to hear Sam gently snoring. Plans were also put in place to visit the hospital during the day – Sam got a blood transfusion."

The medical team here at BC Childrens continue to be amazing.\nChemotherapy continues to take its toll. His energy levels are lower with each round. As with previous rounds Sam’s blood counts are falling and mucositis has set in. We hope that that these side effects will be less intense and that they can be short lived – that Sam does not have to feel gross.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:\n\nWe are thankful for a donor who is a match for Sam and that they are willing to undergo the full bone marrow extraction process!\nWe are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects long term.\nThe medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. All the pieces need to fall into place for the best timing possible.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends.

In-hospital is not where we had hoped to be this Thanks Giving, as family in the area were hoping to host us. It would have been great to share a meal, visit with them, and catch up the additional nephews that had flown in. Despite our current situation we still have so much to be thankful for. Top of my mind:\n\nWe are here and we have access to an incredible medical team and facility.\nWe are able to walk this journey as a family. Support from work, family and friends, church, and the local community allows us to be here without having to worry about life and responsibilities back home. Thank you!\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides us a home away from home.\nSam has been able to connect with friends – especially in the last couple weeks. They talked or talked while playing online games.\nVisitors: We have family in the area that come by on a regular basis to support us. We have friends that make extra efforts to some and see us.\n\n\nHighlights from this past week\n\nBaseline tests and clinic days\n\nAs we begin to wrap up round 6 and pivot to bone-marrow transplant there are many medical appointments. This week was full with regular clinic visits plus the addition of baseline tests.\n\nThursday Nana and Kevin visit\n\nKevin and I got away – we roamed around downtown and grabbed dinner. It was great to away from the hospital campus for a few hours.\n\n\nNana visited with Sam and Tina at the Ronald McDonald House. Following the loss of Gord, Mary has moved south where she is surrounded by family and can access Sam. She in a suite attached to Kevin and Shannon’s.\n\nFriday’s fever\n\nIt was a normal clinic visit on Friday morning. We had gone in expecting to review blood levels and then return to the RMH. However, Sam spiked a fever. In a normal non-cancer scenario any of us would just sleep it off, but Sam’s immune system is compromised. Antibiotics were started, tests and bacterial cultures were ordered, and plans were made to admit Sam to the ward for this past weekend. We are hoping/expecting to be discharged later today to return to the RMH.\n\n\nDave and Louise SP, friends of ours working in SE Asia were able to stop by before catching their flight back. Great to catch up with and be encouraged by them.\n\nSupercars Saturday\n\nOne of the other parents at the RMH was able to connect with a group of Supercar owners. We thought we might miss-out but the doctor here gave Sam an afternoon pass to take part. We were able to talk with the owners, look at, sit in, and got for some quick rides in these beautiful cars. Makes included Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and Mercedes. I think whenever I see one of these cars on the road I will always remember the joy on all the families faces and the hospitality of all the owners."

    "text": "Not an ideal plan\nWe are moving forward with a bone-marrow-transplant (BMT), but we are not in an ideal situation. Ideally, and for best results, when moving to BMT the medical team would like the cancer to be non-detectable. With Sam, starting from where he was back in April, the cancerous mass has been reduced in size, but a significant mass remains. It is not operable as it is in the lymphatic system; although it can be located, as I understand it, it is too amorphous and intertwined within his healthy tissues and bear vital organs (e.g. heart and lungs).\n\nChallenges ahead\nIn the weeks ahead Sam will be facing a number of challenges (see The Plan).\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

    "text": "This past week\n\nTreatment\nSam is currently in his targeted radiation phase, which is intended to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. Each day this past week we went to the BC Cancer clinic at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). During each visit the technician would use a mold of Sam to get him into position. The mold extends from below his shoulders up over his head and they use it to literally pin him to the treatment table ensuring that he is in the exact same position each time – thereby ensuring the radiation focuses on the intended area.\nSam is doing well with it all. Sam is now over thirty days away from the previous chemo-drug treatments and his strength is returning. He is a generally healthy young man, but with cancer. This is where we want him to be – as healthy and as strong as possible before starting the BMT.\nSo far the only side effect from the radiation therapy has been fatigue. It is different than chemo-fatigue which caused him to not have any energy, be nauseated, and caused brain fog. This radiation induced fatigue is the need to sleep, but once awake Sam usually has energy to go for walks and enjoy his life.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe had a good number of family and friends visiting with us this past week. Not everyone got to see Sam as he is being very cautious about seeing people – he is also training Tina and I to do the same as we all mask up more and more. Visitors included:\n\nGram and Papa spent some great time with Sam prior to heading home this past Monday\nNana, now living in the area, was able to come by for the Thursday afternoon.\nUncle Kevin and cousin Kaden were able to be here for a few hours. I love it when Sam and Kaden have a chance to hang out.\nFriday morning I had a great visit with Aaron W.\nFriday afternoon we spent some good time, Colin with Rob, and Tina with Leanne D. They also delivered some great messages of support from our church family in Prince George – thank you all!\nYesterday evening we were able to get away from the RMH and spend the evening with family out in Langley – celebrating our nieces birthdays. We are so fortunate to have family close by."

    "text": "The Chisholm family at the Ronald McDonald House. Fall 20231.\nSam is a courageous champion! He has now endured and completed two types of cancer treatment, and is ready to take-on the upcoming bone marrow transplant (BMT). Over the past six months Sam’s treatments have focused on attacking the cancer cells within his body. He received six rounds of chemical chemotherapy between May and Oct. Over the last two weeks, following the completion of the initial chemotherapy treatment, tactics were changed to use radiation therapy against the largest detectable cancerous mass that remains in the center of his chest. The upcoming BMT will mark a significant change in strategy for removing the cancer. Instead of attacking the cancer directly the BMT will provide a long-term indirect assault on the cancer (long-term being life-long). This process will replace Sam’s immune system – removing his current native immune defenses and replacing them with a donated immune system. Where Sam’s immune system was not effective at detecting and attacking the cancer it is expected that the new immune system will. This process is not easy and Sam may face his greatest challenges to date. However, he is looking forward to completing these next phases.\nThere are currently 8 days until Sam receives the actual transplant. However, there are numerous steps/procedures to be completed to prepare his body for this process. This Wednesday he starts these steps."

    "text": "This past week\n\nTreatment\nIt is amazing to me how a short medical appointment can dominate an entire day. Monday through Friday this past week marked Sam’s second and final week of targeted radiation therapy to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. The actual procedure was usually not more than 15 minutes but it would dominate out entire day. Each day we would get ready, load up and head down to the BC Cancer clinic, a short drive away. Tina and Sam would check in while I attempted to find parking – there were a few days where Sam was done before I was able to park the van. Following treatment we would return to the RMH. Sam has generally felt well though with increasing fatigue. His medical team is happy with his current health: He is an otherwise healthy young man, but with cancer.\nWe may never know the full impact that the radiation will have on the cancer. The radiation therapy can take weeks to show measurable impacts but by that point we will be well into the BMT process. I expect next scans to evaluate the various treatments and the state of the cancer will not be feasible until into the new year.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe were able to visit with and be encouraged by some family and friends this past week. Aunt Tricia put on an amazing meal. Uncle Cal paid a visit. Sam was able to have some time hanging out with cousin Kaden, while Tina and I visited with Kevin, Shannon, and Nana. Yesterday John, Jess, Kate, and John Jr. stopped by for a few hours. Tina was able to have and afternoon away visiting with her cousins in Abbotsford."

He has been nauseous and ill, has had distinct new pains, and slept most of the day and continues to sleep now. Talking with the doctors all of the new symptoms are common to the TBI.\nSam continues to be strong. Halfway through the afternoon treatment he was nauseated, he took a few minutes to puke, then with a let’s-do-this-determination positioned himself to complete the second half of that treatment."

He woke up with a bright attitude and energy to take on the day. He really enjoyed his visit with his friends Chase and Caleb C. Ahh so good to see friends – what a bright highlight to our day! Following this visit Sam had a big nap.\nUnfortunately, Sam woke up shortly after shift change in piecing pain – the side effects of chemo had set in while he had slept. When he woke mucositis had had left his mouth as an open wound, raw and full of sores. I am sure as many of you know from your own experiences it is hard to watch your child in pain. It took some time to get new orders but solutions were found. We had to wait an abnormal amount of time for the pain specialist team… we had to wait because they were helping some other poor child with their pain.\nBetween 10pm and 1am we had some needed victories:\nA special thanks to our nursing team who advocated for Sam and took on all of the additional task needed to get Sam comfortable.

    "text": "Transplant ongoing\n\n\n\nSam started receiving the donated bone-marrow/ stem cells at 5:06pm. It is 6:50pm as I write this. Everything is going well as Sam has not had any reactions to these currently foreign cells – cells that will become his own. He should have all finish reciving the material in the next twenty minutes. Sam is sleeping through it all.\nToday is the day and Sam is ready!\nSam had a couple rough days leading up to today but he is now comfortable, settled into the the isolation room, and ready to take on the BMT. The actual transplant will happen later today and should be rather anti-climatic. The transplant is similar to receiving blood the difference being that the material in the bag will be bone marrow stem cells. These cells will take up residence in Sam’s bone marrow and start generating new blood – transplanted blood providing a new immune system.\nYesterday went well. The greatest challenge was moving Sam across the hall. It sounds simple but I was wiped out by the end of the day. In moving over everything had to be sterilized. Most items were thoroughly wiped, and placed in clean containers. Laundry had to be re-done as I had not washed the clothes to BMT clean standards. The medical team also had a big task taking all of the furniture out of the room, sterilized the room, and then they cleaned and sterilized each piece of furniture before returning it.\nSam’s isolation room is similar to the other rooms here on the ward. It has his medical bed, a recliner chair and a fold down couch/bed for Tina and I. The difference is that there is a small anteroom. This room has two sets of glass sliding doors. One door leads to the ward and the other to Sam’s room. Only one door is allowed to be open at one time to ensure that the air in Sam’s room is clean. In the anteroom we clean any items before they are passed into the room. It also in this room that we put on gowns to cover out ‘dirty’ outside world clothing. It is actually much simpler for Tina and I to leave and enter than I had expected.\nYesterday’s highlights was seeing friends. Sam was able to visit with Ben while Tina and I visited with David and Krista C. – following their visit Sam moved to the isolation room. In the evening Uncle Cal stopped was able to wave at Sam through the window. Senga and Tina were also able visit."

    "text": "As I begin writing it is 6:30am, Day +1 of Sam’s BMT. This morning I am sitting beside Sam’s bed, to protect him I am all gowned up and masked. Tina and I spent the night in the room and all things considered he is doing well.\nAt 5:06pm Nov. 14, 2023 Sam started to received his new bone-marrow stem cells. Two hours later the IV drip was complete and the donated cells had been received. As hoped receiving the donor cells was very uneventful. Sam had been pre-medicated with numerous drugs to facilitate receiving these foreign cells. A good number of those drugs also cause drowsiness – so Sam slept through most of the procedure. Although there were many hands ready to jump into action should something go wrong, nothing did! Sam’s vitals were and continue to remain within stable limits. Now we wait.\nSo far things have gone as well as we could hope but it is still not easy on Sam. His body aches. He often has nausea. Although he is hungry very little appetites him. The pain and anti-nausea meds help but not entirely. Sam has gone through a lot and the most recent steps have literally taken a lot out of him. With organ-transplants surgeons cut out the existing organ and incredibly put in the donated one. With a BMT, it is a mind-trip, but we had to kill a part of Sam to make way for the transplant material. With the way made and the new cells received, we now wait.\nIn this period of waiting a silent battle wages inside Sam’s body. Vitals (e.g. blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates) are monitored. Chemical metrics are monitored through regular bodily fluids (blood and urine). Over the next weeks the transplant material should establish. The team here has been excellent at passing on information as it come in so we will learn more as we go. Metrics indicating the successful engraftment/establishment of the stem cells are not expected for 2-3 weeks."

Here is what I currently understand:\n\nWe will be watching for the day the BMT is officially considered engrafted (3 consecutive days of ANC \\(\\geq 0.5\\)).\nSam will begin a step-down process as his body heals from the intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy that was used to condition his body to receive the transplant. Currently, he receiving significant external supports: nutrition is being delivered via NG tube and TPN (IV delivery), and he is on a continuous schedule of numerous drugs. In the step down process these supports will slowly be removed, and drugs will be converted to oral delivery.\nOver the next couple months Sam will be watched closely for signs of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD)– essentially that the new immune system does not harm Sam.\nWe should be out of hospital and back the Ronald McDonald House before Christmas."

    "text": "Victories and concerns\n\nWhat an incredible birthday present. Sam’s ANC blood metric went from non-detectable to 0.3. A strong indicator that the transplant is taking hold!\nWe are thankful that Sam has felt the love of his community around him – especially on his birthday.\nWe very thankful for the successful delivery of the donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation I cannot thank you enough.\nThankful that what Sam has experienced so far is within the normal for a BMT and that he has not had any complications. Although it is all in the ‘normal’, it is not all easy:\n\nImpacts from the pre-treatment, chemotherapy and radiation, remain strong. These cause deep bone and muscle pain, along with nausea.\nPain management is constantly under revision. Update: We seem to have the right mix. Pain and nausea are currently under control\nNutrition is received by TPN (IV), NG tube, and minority by mouth.\nEnergy levels are low – it is great to see Sam have energy to sit up and play when he can.\n\nThere will be ongoing concern as many known and unknown pitfalls that may present themselves during the BMT process. Potential illness, establishment/engraftment of the donated bone-marrow/ stem cells. Numerous other potential complications.\n\nUpdate: Sam did have an infection earlier this week. Within about 45 minutes of detection he was on antibiotics and was cleared out quickly. The team here says that this happens to everyone going through a BMT.\n\nWe are thankful to the medical team who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great confidence.\nWe are thankful for all of the messages of encouragement and solidarity that we have received from all of you.\nWe are thankful that it seems Sam’s pain management is now mostly under control, including options to address any spikes in pain.\nIt had been amazing to see Sam out from under the influence of chemotherapy. To see him return to strength of mind and to have capacity for more activity. It is hard to see him have this strength pulled away from him.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nIt is flu season and covid is still out there. If any of us get sick it will add challenges to Sam and the BMT process as he is in a phase where he has no immune system for the next few weeks.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that had to come together:\n\nDone! Thank you! Due to some timing and logistics we have had to change donors. We are thankful for this current donor who will provide a peripheral blood sample and is a good match for Sam.\nContinuing: We are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects long term.\nDone! The medical team has a huge coordination task ahead of them. From our meetings with them it seems all of the pieces are coming together, but with so many moving parts it is easy for things go wrong.\nDone! Although it was rough at points the BMT conditioning was successful! These last days leading up to the BMT are very busy with lots of drugs running all day. Concerns during this time are that everything is able to be delivered as planned and that Sam does not have any overly negative reactions to any of this.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

    "text": "Yesterday, Sam’s birthday\n\nBy the numbers\nWhile attempting to secretly decorate Sam’s room in the early morning hours Sam’s nurse provided me with the results of that night’s bloodwork – the numbers were exciting. Sam was hoping that on his birthday there would be some indication that the BMT was taking hold. Two days ago the bloodwork hinted that something was happening. For Sam’s birthday the bloodwork numbers were more than we hoped. Our hope was that his ANC, a metric of immune system strength, would hit 0.1. All week it had been &lt; 0.1 (essentially non-detectable) and for Sam’s birthday it jumped to 0.3!\nThis is exciting news! The numbers indicate that engraftment is happening, that the BMT is taking hold, though it will not be considered definitive until the ANC exceeds 0.5 for a three consecutive days and some additional tests are run.\n\n\nA great birthday\nSam had a great day. The ANC of 0.3 had everyone excited, the three of us, the nurses, and the doctors, and this set a great tone for the day. Sam’s body is working overtime generating new blood so he rested a lot, pain and nausea have been under control for the last 48 hours.\nSam was able to have video-calls with his grandparents. Thoughout the afternoon, as a family, we loved reviewing messages, and video messages with birthday greetings. The nurses on shift all piled into the anteroom to sing Sam happy birthday and deliver a cake – he was even able to eat some of it! Of course there were presents which Sam took his time opening, reading the cards and enjoying every word written and gift sent. Thank you!"

Results indicated that we continue to move in the right direction. The cancer was reduced in size and remained in known locations – that is it had not spread anywhere else. However, it was also apparent that the rate of reduction was not enough to remove the cancer by the end of this chemotherapy regime.\nRound six of Sam’s initial chemotherapy treatment is now complete. The PET scan results support the current plan to provide a bone marrow transplant. As the BMT date approaches Sam will have a number of tests to determine his baseline health before starting his bone-marrow-transplant protocol."

    "text": "BMT Plan\nBMT: Bone Marrow Transplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nI feel I need a quick disclaimer here as I am not sure I have all of this right. In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there … dates and details are likely to change.\n\n\n\nOverview\nThis is the plan as I understand it:\n\nSam has completed the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.\nIn preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam’s health going into BMT.\nBone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is expected to be Nov. 14 .\nFollowing the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0. Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.\n\nDays -22 to -11 (~Oct. 23): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.\nDay -6 and -4: Full body radiation to ensure Sam’s own immune system is completely removed – in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system.\nDays -3 to -1: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam’s own immune system.\nDay zero, currently planned for Nov. 14, Sam should receive the transplant. This is actually quite simple – like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam’s body via his central line.\nDays 0 to 30 Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.\nDays 31 through 90: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Objectives\n\n\nChallenges ahead\nBelow is copied from our Oct. 20st post\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

    "text": "Wow! It has been an amazing 48 hours!\nTuesday, two days ago, Santa visited a number of hospitals in the province and our family got to be a part of this celebration. Sam was able to be one of the first to welcome him to the ward and the staff loved his enthusiasm! I am still stunned by the opportunity Tina had to speak with the CBC, with how well she was able to capture what this Christmas means to us, and how it also let the medical team know how important they have been to us.\nYesterday, was a major Christmas present for our family: Sam was discharged from the ward and we are all back at the Ronald McDonald House!\nBefore leaving there was a short ceremony where all of the nurses gathered, a speech was given by one of the doctors to honor Sam for all of the work that he as undertaken – noting especially how he taken such responsibility in understanding the treatments and communicating so well with the team. After, Sam walked out the doors in stark contrast to his arrival by air ambulance eight months ago! He was done and ready to move on – though a part of him will miss the amazing people that have cared for him these last weeks (BMT) and months (Chemotherapy).\nWe will be based at the RMH for the next two months. In this time Sam will be at clinic 2-3 times per week to monitor for potential graft versus host disease (GVHD) which will likely mean lots of minor adjustments to his medications. He has a long list of medications but over time this will be reduced."

    "text": "Victories and concerns\n\nSam has completed his critical post-transplant period. He has now been discharged from the hospital! We will remain at the RMH for the next two months in order to monitor for potential GVHD complications.\nSam is returning to strength! Having received his discharge paper, he walked out of the hospital back towards the RMH. He made it most of the way back before powering out and transferring to the chair. With the way he has been eating his return to strength will continue to be rapid!\nSam’s bones are generating new blood! The engraftment process is working! We have seen Sam’s numbers come up and now stabilize!\nSam will still be considered immune compromised for the months ahead and mostly susceptible to viral infection. It remains to be flu season and covid is still out there. We must continue to be vigilant to protect Sam.\nWe very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation I cannot thank you enough.\nWe are thankful to the medical team who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great confidence.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nWe are thankful for all of the messages of encouragement and solidarity that we have received from all of you.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

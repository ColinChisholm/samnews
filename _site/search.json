    "text": "Wow! It has been an amazing 48 hours!\nTuesday, two days ago, Santa visited a number of hospitals in the province and our family got to be a part of this celebration. Sam was able to be one of the first to welcome him to the ward and the staff loved his enthusiasm! I am still stunned by the opportunity Tina had to speak with the CBC, with how well she was able to capture what this Christmas means to us, and how it also let the medical team know how important they have been to us.\nYesterday, was a major Christmas present for our family: Sam was discharged from the ward and we are all back at the Ronald McDonald House!\nBefore leaving there was a short ceremony where all of the nurses gathered, a speech was given by one of the doctors to honor Sam for all of the work that he as undertaken – noting especially how he taken such responsibility in understanding the treatments and communicating so well with the team. After, Sam walked out the doors in stark contrast to his arrival by air ambulance eight months ago! He was done and ready to move on – though a part of him will miss the amazing people that have cared for him these last weeks (BMT) and months (Chemotherapy).\nWe will be based at the RMH for the next two months. In this time Sam will be at clinic 2-3 times per week to monitor for potential graft versus host disease (GVHD) which will likely mean lots of minor adjustments to his medications. He has a long list of medications but over time this will be reduced."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less.

    "text": "The past days\n\n\n\n\nSam and I walking from the RMH to the hospital for a clinic visit. This was the first morning Sam did not need to ride in the chair (Dec. 22nd)!\n\n\n\n\nSam continues to have regular visits at the clinic. Various blood tests are done each time. One specific, the team looks at Tacrolimus levels, an immunosuppressant used to ensure that this BMT is successful and that any graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is minimized. Note: some GVHD is needed so that the new immune system continues to attack any remaining cancer.\nExciting news! The genetic testing of Sam’s immune system confirmed that the donor cells have fully replaced Sam’s native immune system. Ideally, in a BMT transplant the native immune system is removed to make way for the donor cells. There is always a chance that some native cells remain and that a battle for dominance can occur. For Sam, the BMT has gone as planned and all new blood is being generated by the donor cells.\nAll of the blood tests have shown Sam’s counts have come up and are stabilizing.\nI have debated including this next thought … especially during Christmas. It is a challenging reality (skip it if you need to).\n\nSkipRead\n\n\nor click ‘Read’ above\n\n\nChristmas at the Ronald McDonald House is amazing but strange – layered in hope and pain. There is so much generosity poured into this place you cannot help but feel cared for.\n\nDuring these last months, as we have weathered this cancer storm, we have also walked beside a number of other families in similar circumstances. Some are looking forward to completing treatment, while others are in the thick of the storm. Another family, is having an incredibly hard Christmas. They have reached the end of possible treatments and recently moved to hospice to spend what days remain with their child. Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to them.\n\nHere at the Ronald McDonald House joys and pains are especially visible. For me, this raises an inescapable question for life at home. If your Christmas is full of joy, and I truly hope it is, are there pains that may be close but remain unseen? Is there a way to demonstrate love and generosity into those situations?\n\n\n\nSome good normal life has been happening.\n\nSam has had energy to enjoy reading. He finished The Hobbit earlier this week and immediately got into another book.\nNana was able to visit and help us prepare for Christmas.\nWe were able to get off the hospital campus and visit the Frickers – with more family visits planned over the holidays. So great to play family games… this year games also includes some VR which actually has been an amazing physical rehabilitation tool."

    "text": "Looking forward\nIn the weeks ahead we will need to keep a close eye on Sam’s energy levels. We have been given some flexibility in managing steroidal supports (e.g. in response to illness or injury). So if we see his energy fading we can pump him up a little. The steroids are intended to mimic natural bodily levels, as given the previous BMT related treatments his body is not yet generating natural responses – this is all expected (by the doctors). It is also expected that Sam’s own hormone balancing system will restart after a month or two. Again we wait and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope in the waiting\n\n\n\nI can’t help but remember that when we were learning Spanish, in our days working in Guatemala, that verb esperar means to wait, and it also mean to hope (the noun for hope is la esperanza). So when we say we wait – I also mean we hope. Of course, hope itself is a choice. In many ways it is a choice to expect the good and to actively reject living in anxiety. This is more than a psychological trick. Our hope and trust have true foundations. I have hope because of our incredible medical team, and ultimately we have hope in God.\n\n\n\nMedical plans\nThis week will be a return to regular clinic visits. We will also start a repeat of all of the baseline testing that was done prior to the BMT. This will involve visits to all of the specialties in the hospital, and various imaging tests to evaluate if/how this whole BMT journey has impacted Sam.\nWe will also continue weaning the various drugs that Sam has been on – primarily reducing morphine levels."

    "text": "Feb. 9, 2024\n\n\n\nJust a quick update as we continue on this journey.\nThis treatment recovery phase seems long. I shouldn’t be surprised by this, all journeys seems long when you are nearing the end. It is always that last couple hours of a long drive that seem the longest.\nIn this situation, Sam has had some incredible things done to him. The pace of activities and medical interventions has slowed drastically, and Sam’s health is continuing to move in the right direction. His strength and stamina are returning/rebuilding. Sam still struggles with some pain but it has shifted from deep bone pains related to the chemical treatments to muscle pains as he rebuilds his core strength. Everything is moving in the right direction and returning home is getting closer!\nIt has been a good week. Sam has had a distinct return of his appetite and with it he is growing in strength. The discipline of choosing hope, discussed in my last post, has been getting easier given that we are not faced with so many unknowns and anxieties are being replaced with relief.\nOn the medical side, Sam’s medical team is happy to see him regaining capacity. Clinic appointments are becoming less frequent (we are transitioning from 2-3 times per week to just once), and the repeat of the baseline medical testing has been ongoing. Sam should get is central-line removed within the next two weeks.\nNow, our thoughts are turning towards home and what it will mean to return there. Our current expectation is to return near the end of February. Returning will not be as simple as jumping back into life like-it-was. Sam’s immune system, though getting stronger, will still be compromised – the team here suggests that it will take a year before his immune system is back to full-strength. His stamina is building but we will need to guard his capacity. What does this mean practically? I am not sure, but here are a couple guesses: visits will need to be individual or in small groups and we will still need to avoid crowds – at least with Sam. Sam’s diminished strength may mean that visits are short and that he simply powers-out partway through. The return to normal will be in small steps … but we are getting there!\nIt is amazing to think of returning home. Returning to friends and family – we have missed you! It is also amazing to start counting down days! For long time we counted up – not knowing when the end would be. Now the end is in sight! Sam has made it through all of his treatments and it feels like we are on an exit-ramp – we can start preparing for home!"

Please ask your children to reach out to Sam so that he knows he is not alone. Let him know that he is missed and that they are praying/ caring for him despite the physical distance.

    "text": "PET scan results\nAlthough busy with regular clinic check-ins, we have had to bide our time since Sam received his bone marrow transplant – 93 days ago. Imaging has had to wait as there was so much going on in Sam’s body it was not possible to get a new image of the state of the cancer. Our assumptions and our hopes were that the prior treatments would have set the cancer back and that the new immune system would then attack anything that remains. However, the PET scan revealed a more complex picture.\n\nOriginal cancerous mass\nImagery of the original mass suggested that the radiation therapy destroyed much of the cancer and likely that there is an on-going war between Sam’s new immune system and the remaining disease. The imagery of this site looks like a solar eclipse – with no activity in the middle, where the radiation focused, but with high activity/avidity around the edges.\n\n\nNew sites\nPerhaps more alarming is that cancer is now active in new areas of Sam’s body. There are three new locations, all of which appear to be within bones (something we have not seen before). Working bottom-up, new sites of cancer are located in Sam’s\n\nleft shin (tibia) slightly below his knee\nhip (right ilium)\nback (T3 vertebrae, between his shoulder blades)\n\nNone of these are currently causing any additional impacts (e.g. bones are still strong, and no nerve impacts). Sam does have some back pain which is likely related to the spot there. These new sites raise questions and there will be a flurry of activity as plans of attack are made."

Next up:\n\nCompleted, Feb 16 morning: CT scan of the T3 vertebrae to assess risk and provide imaging that will assist with treatment planning.\nCompeted, Feb 16: Discussion with with the Orthopedic surgery team to discuss/plan a biopsy of the cancer in Sam’s shin (the easiest of the new sites to access). This was completed by our medical team and it was determined that this biopsy would not be feasible.\nFeb 22: An alternate option is scheduled to biopsy the new cancer in Sam’s back.\nCompleted, Feb 16: Discussion with Radiation Oncologist to discuss new radiation based treatments. Our medical team has been in communication with them and the Radiation team is ready when and if needed.\nOngoing: reduce medications that have kept Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) in-check.

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nIt has been a whirlwind of a week filled with anxious waiting, clinic visits most days, pain management, prayers, and the love of family.\nIt was one week ago today that Sam had a biopsy of one of the new disease sites. That procedure went exactly as planned and the tissue was sent to the BC Cancer lab for analysis – though we would not hear about the results until after the weekend.\nFriday we were in clinic for a regular blood levels check and a quick exam. At the time, I was asked if Sam’s symptoms had changed and all I could say was ‘No, he seems to be doing well’. However, that would change over the following days as new pains mounted. I think of these as pain-spikes as they would come on quickly and cause changes in his pain management regime (i.e. drug doses were increased). We are thankful that we have such access to medical advice – though Sam and Tina deserve direct credit for sorting out the latest pain-spike.\n\nThe Finding and The Plan\n\nDuring Tuesday’s visit Dr. Jacob let us all know about the results of the biopsy. The new disease sites are the same cancer (primarily characterized by its INI1 protein deletion). This information was critical to know in order to determine what treatments would be available for Sam. To be honest, the medical toolkit is getting low in options, but at least we still do have options:\n\nFurther chemotherapy is not an option. This cancer has become resistant and that line of therapy would put Sam’s new immune system at risk.\n\nRadiation can be applied but is not a long term solution. We will use it to reduce the burden-of-disease on Sam. In particular it will be used on his T3-vertebrae to prevent potential growth at that site from impinging on Sam’s nerves.\nA drug therapy for Sam has been approved. Nivolumab is used for immunotherapy, though special approval was needed to use it on a BMT recipient. In general terms, this drug will take-the-brakes off Sam’s immune system. Specifically, and as I understand it, this drug disables proteins on the cancer cells that allow them to remain invisible to the immune system. This is a very similar philosophy of treatment as the BMT – to enable the immune system, and in Sam’s case to support his new immune system, to identify and destroy the cancer.\nThe challenge is, until recently we have done the opposite, keeping the immune system brakes on so that the new immune system will not harm Sam’s healthy tissues. The medical team will be watching him closely. The goal: release the immune system to attack while watching for signs that the immune system does not harm Sam – it will be a fine balance.\n\nThere are risks but we are excited to move forward with this option/opportunity to destroy this disease. Sam is excited and these options and expected hospital times, depending on how he tolerates the treatment, could be less difficult than he had imagined.\nToday Sam will start this new immunotherapy treatment. He will be in-hospital for several days to ensure there are no complications. Assuming there are none we will be back at the RMH early next week.\nTomorrow Sam will also make a trip to the BC Cancer Clinic at VGH to have a CT scan which will provide the radiation oncology team the data that they need to complete the planning of their treatments."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

My favourite quotes come from him on a near daily basis: “I have an amazing life” or “I am so happy”. His challenges are beyond my wildest nightmares but he remains strong, and full of hope. He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less. Tina’s family has been close by and have been able to visit. My parents travelled down and were able to be here, support us, and spend some great time with Sam over several days."

    "text": "Recap of the last week\n\nCancer war\nIt has been over a week since I last wrote and we have been continuing along two lines of attack against the cancer in Sam’s body.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nEach weekday we have made a trip down to the BC Cancer Centre, about a 10 minute drive away. Sam is/has undergone targeted radiation for the three new disease sites discovered last month. These visits are fairly quick with about 15 minutes needed per site and most of that time is simply setting up/positioning Sam to target the sites the same way each time. Last week treatment of the sites below his knee and on his hip were completed – as these were not near critical organs they received higher doses of radiation per treatment. Treatment of the disease on Sam’s back will be completed at the end of this week. Evaluation of how well the treatments worked will not be for a minimum of 2-3 weeks.\n\nImmune therapy\n\nLast Thursday, Sam was due to have another dose of Nivolumab two weeks following his initial dose. However, this second dose was delayed as his bloodwork suggested that his liver was inflamed and as such it could be dangerous to give another dose. It was a good decision! Over this past weekend Sam has much stronger symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) than we have seen the entire time since receiving his bone marrow transplant (BMT).\n\n\nAs a reminder, the intent of the BMT was to give Sam a new immune system that would recognize the cancer and destroy it. The weeks following the transplant Sam was on a medication to keep the new immune system in-check and reduce symptoms of GVHD. Now that we know that there is more cancer, steps are being taken to release the new immune system to be more aggressive. Essentially, using different drugs, we went from applying the brakes to the immune system to adding fuel to it. The goal: activate/jump-start the immune system to attack the cancer. Of course doing this has the potential to unleash the immune system to also attack Sam’s healthy tissues.\n\n\nThis past weekend Sam had intense rashes and evidence that the GVHD was not only active on the outside of his body but also the inside (e.g. loss of taste, increased liver enzymes). The GVHD seemed to reach a peak on the weekend. Recent bloodwork seems to align with the symptoms we have been observing. If Sam’s immune system continues to settle back down we will likely continue with this line of treatment.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral living\nSam’s life is pretty simple: watching too much YouTube, and when he has more energy, he reads, plays video games (only rarely able to sit up to play on his PC), and occasionally reviews some studies. Lately, his activity has been limited to short walks, mostly around the RMH. He also enjoys visiting with people, though his capacity can often be low causing visits to be short (e.g. 30 minutes). Despite the length of this journey and current challenges Sam still maintains a positive attitude with statements like: “I love my life.”, “I am so happy”, “We have a great family”.\nOur parental pride swelled earlier this week. A boy here at the RMH, I’ll call him B., is about five years old and has looked up to Sam. B. was having a hard week and mad at the world – Sam decided to brighten his day. Sam chose a lego set which I purchased when I was out. Sam was able to give it to him the next day and also spent some time helping him assemble it. B. was thrilled! So great that Sam took the opportunity to care for this young man!\nWe continue to enjoy visits with family. Tina’s family members, who live in the region, try to make a point of being here each week. We look forward to seeing them on their usual days.\nWe also love to see friends as they are able to come through. This past week it was great to see Jess and John with Kate and John (Jr.)."

Most importantly – Sam’s friends. It was spring break for the schools and a few friends were able to visit during this time.\nChase came and stayed with us/Sam for a number of days. Ben, along with the rest of his family, was able to visit a couple different times. I am thankful that these boys were able see Sam when he was up and when he was down and simply accept him where he was at.\nWe also love the times we can connect with family, here at the RMH, at their homes, and at a hockey game.\n\n\nHockey\nSam has really been enjoying hockey during this difficult period. He looks forward to watching games. Since I last wrote we were able to attend two.\nFirst, we attended the WHL’s Vancouver Giants versus Kelowna Rockets. This was a special family time as we were gifted box seats to the game. Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the three of us plus Chase there.\nThis past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with a party atmosphere at the arena!"

    "text": "Cancer war\nSam has summarized this the past two PET scans in the following way (paraphrased):\n\nThe PET scan in February was like someone dumped a load of bricks on me.\nThis last PET scan was like someone removed all the bricks but then threw a single one at me.\n\nSam is great spirits. As the impacts of radiation therapy are behind him, and the effects of GVHD1 are lessening he is seeing his energy return. Today he wants to go grocery shopping with me.\n\nReview\nThe previous PET, on Feb 14, did provide really hard news. Following months of seeing a new immune system be established in Sam (Nov. - Feb) that imaging showed three new disease sites – it seemed that all of the previous efforts were for naught and that we were losing the cancer war. Despite all of the efforts of the BMT to establishing a new immune system, it did not seem to be effective at beating back the cancer.\nSince the discovery of the new sites Sam has received immunotherapy (via the drug Nivomulab) as well as targeted radiation treatment to the new disease centers. The radiation therapy was straight forward and ended a couple weeks ago. With the immune therapy Sam was only able to have a single dose of the Nivomulab which triggered more GVHD2 than he had seen during his BMT3. Although this GVHD was not physically comfortable (e.g. hot rashes, GI4 effects) it was mentally comforting – if the immune system was attacking healthy tissue it meant that it was most likely also attacking the cancer. Most recently, the immune system started getting dangerously out of control by stressing Sam’s liver. In response to that he has started some steroids to put the brakes on his immune system and bring it back in-check.\nThis sets the stage for the PET scan this past Friday (April 5).\n\n\nPET scan results\nApril 5th scan\n\nRadiated sites\nWe have clear wins! No cancer was detectable in the three sites discovered back in Feb. The cancer in his T3 vertebrae, hip, and shin has been wiped out by the radiation therapy.\n\n\nCentral mass\nThe mass in the center of Sam’s chest, the one that brought us down here to start with, is stable. There is increased metabolic activity in the area but it remains the same size as previous – and potentially a little smaller. What is exciting about this is that the only thing keeping this site in-check would have been Sam’s immune system. The fact that this site is stable suggests that the immune system is able to battle whatever cancer is still in this area.\n\n\nChallenges\nA single new site has been located. The new site is located in Sam’s liver. For now we have to assume that this is new disease site (i.e. the same type of cancer in a new location). However, it is possible that is something else. The liver is a big organ, one that is hard to do surgery on, but this new site is superficial (near the surface) just below Sam’s lower rib on the right side. Given where this site is we are hoping that a biopsy can be completed this coming week."

It is good to know that the chemical brakes work, at the same time we do not what to suppress the immune system too long as it is the main method of battling the cancer.\nWe are thankful to the medical team here at BC Childrens’ Hospital who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.\nWe are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care.

If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nThe cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam’s body. The sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), and newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and left shin (tibia just below the knee).\nWe long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

The majority of the time his energy is low but we do get glimpses of our real Sam full of energy and life.\nThe ambiguity of not knowing if treatments are working and delays in treatment are challenging – to the point of terrifying. We have managed the not-knowing well, but our reserves/defenses are drained/weakened.\nThankful that Sam’s pain levels have been stable and generally easy to manage. The main challenges are related to the GVHD, specifically with rashes, which are not painful but are at times very itchy and hot.\nThe new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam’s immune system to hit harder.

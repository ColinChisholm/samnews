    "text": "Wow! It has been an amazing 48 hours!\nTuesday, two days ago, Santa visited a number of hospitals in the province and our family got to be a part of this celebration. Sam was able to be one of the first to welcome him to the ward and the staff loved his enthusiasm! I am still stunned by the opportunity Tina had to speak with the CBC, with how well she was able to capture what this Christmas means to us, and how it also let the medical team know how important they have been to us.\nYesterday, was a major Christmas present for our family: Sam was discharged from the ward and we are all back at the Ronald McDonald House!\nBefore leaving there was a short ceremony where all of the nurses gathered, a speech was given by one of the doctors to honor Sam for all of the work that he as undertaken – noting especially how he taken such responsibility in understanding the treatments and communicating so well with the team. After, Sam walked out the doors in stark contrast to his arrival by air ambulance eight months ago! He was done and ready to move on – though a part of him will miss the amazing people that have cared for him these last weeks (BMT) and months (Chemotherapy).\nWe will be based at the RMH for the next two months. In this time Sam will be at clinic 2-3 times per week to monitor for potential graft versus host disease (GVHD) which will likely mean lots of minor adjustments to his medications. He has a long list of medications but over time this will be reduced."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less.

    "text": "The past days\n\n\n\n\nSam and I walking from the RMH to the hospital for a clinic visit. This was the first morning Sam did not need to ride in the chair (Dec. 22nd)!\n\n\n\n\nSam continues to have regular visits at the clinic. Various blood tests are done each time. One specific, the team looks at Tacrolimus levels, an immunosuppressant used to ensure that this BMT is successful and that any graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is minimized. Note: some GVHD is needed so that the new immune system continues to attack any remaining cancer.\nExciting news! The genetic testing of Sam’s immune system confirmed that the donor cells have fully replaced Sam’s native immune system. Ideally, in a BMT transplant the native immune system is removed to make way for the donor cells. There is always a chance that some native cells remain and that a battle for dominance can occur. For Sam, the BMT has gone as planned and all new blood is being generated by the donor cells.\nAll of the blood tests have shown Sam’s counts have come up and are stabilizing.\nI have debated including this next thought … especially during Christmas. It is a challenging reality (skip it if you need to).\n\nSkipRead\n\n\nor click ‘Read’ above\n\n\nChristmas at the Ronald McDonald House is amazing but strange – layered in hope and pain. There is so much generosity poured into this place you cannot help but feel cared for.\n\nDuring these last months, as we have weathered this cancer storm, we have also walked beside a number of other families in similar circumstances. Some are looking forward to completing treatment, while others are in the thick of the storm. Another family, is having an incredibly hard Christmas. They have reached the end of possible treatments and recently moved to hospice to spend what days remain with their child. Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to them.\n\nHere at the Ronald McDonald House joys and pains are especially visible. For me, this raises an inescapable question for life at home. If your Christmas is full of joy, and I truly hope it is, are there pains that may be close but remain unseen? Is there a way to demonstrate love and generosity into those situations?\n\n\n\nSome good normal life has been happening.\n\nSam has had energy to enjoy reading. He finished The Hobbit earlier this week and immediately got into another book.\nNana was able to visit and help us prepare for Christmas.\nWe were able to get off the hospital campus and visit the Frickers – with more family visits planned over the holidays. So great to play family games… this year games also includes some VR which actually has been an amazing physical rehabilitation tool."

    "text": "Looking forward\nIn the weeks ahead we will need to keep a close eye on Sam’s energy levels. We have been given some flexibility in managing steroidal supports (e.g. in response to illness or injury). So if we see his energy fading we can pump him up a little. The steroids are intended to mimic natural bodily levels, as given the previous BMT related treatments his body is not yet generating natural responses – this is all expected (by the doctors). It is also expected that Sam’s own hormone balancing system will restart after a month or two. Again we wait and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope in the waiting\n\n\n\nI can’t help but remember that when we were learning Spanish, in our days working in Guatemala, that verb esperar means to wait, and it also mean to hope (the noun for hope is la esperanza). So when we say we wait – I also mean we hope. Of course, hope itself is a choice. In many ways it is a choice to expect the good and to actively reject living in anxiety. This is more than a psychological trick. Our hope and trust have true foundations. I have hope because of our incredible medical team, and ultimately we have hope in God.\n\n\n\nMedical plans\nThis week will be a return to regular clinic visits. We will also start a repeat of all of the baseline testing that was done prior to the BMT. This will involve visits to all of the specialties in the hospital, and various imaging tests to evaluate if/how this whole BMT journey has impacted Sam.\nWe will also continue weaning the various drugs that Sam has been on – primarily reducing morphine levels."

    "text": "Feb. 9, 2024\n\n\n\nJust a quick update as we continue on this journey.\nThis treatment recovery phase seems long. I shouldn’t be surprised by this, all journeys seems long when you are nearing the end. It is always that last couple hours of a long drive that seem the longest.\nIn this situation, Sam has had some incredible things done to him. The pace of activities and medical interventions has slowed drastically, and Sam’s health is continuing to move in the right direction. His strength and stamina are returning/rebuilding. Sam still struggles with some pain but it has shifted from deep bone pains related to the chemical treatments to muscle pains as he rebuilds his core strength. Everything is moving in the right direction and returning home is getting closer!\nIt has been a good week. Sam has had a distinct return of his appetite and with it he is growing in strength. The discipline of choosing hope, discussed in my last post, has been getting easier given that we are not faced with so many unknowns and anxieties are being replaced with relief.\nOn the medical side, Sam’s medical team is happy to see him regaining capacity. Clinic appointments are becoming less frequent (we are transitioning from 2-3 times per week to just once), and the repeat of the baseline medical testing has been ongoing. Sam should get is central-line removed within the next two weeks.\nNow, our thoughts are turning towards home and what it will mean to return there. Our current expectation is to return near the end of February. Returning will not be as simple as jumping back into life like-it-was. Sam’s immune system, though getting stronger, will still be compromised – the team here suggests that it will take a year before his immune system is back to full-strength. His stamina is building but we will need to guard his capacity. What does this mean practically? I am not sure, but here are a couple guesses: visits will need to be individual or in small groups and we will still need to avoid crowds – at least with Sam. Sam’s diminished strength may mean that visits are short and that he simply powers-out partway through. The return to normal will be in small steps … but we are getting there!\nIt is amazing to think of returning home. Returning to friends and family – we have missed you! It is also amazing to start counting down days! For long time we counted up – not knowing when the end would be. Now the end is in sight! Sam has made it through all of his treatments and it feels like we are on an exit-ramp – we can start preparing for home!"

When you reach out and express your care, your solidarity, and your prayers, you are the hands and feet and face of Christ to us.\nPlease continue to reach out to us – we need you. Please ask your children to reach out to Sam so that he knows he is not alone. Let him know that he is missed and that they are praying/ caring for him despite the physical distance. Many thanks to those who have reached out already and especially to Sam’s friends for reaching out to him.\nThe initial feeling of having our world rocked have shifted.

    "text": "PET scan results\nAlthough busy with regular clinic check-ins, we have had to bide our time since Sam received his bone marrow transplant – 93 days ago. Imaging has had to wait as there was so much going on in Sam’s body it was not possible to get a new image of the state of the cancer. Our assumptions and our hopes were that the prior treatments would have set the cancer back and that the new immune system would then attack anything that remains. However, the PET scan revealed a more complex picture.\n\nOriginal cancerous mass\nImagery of the original mass suggested that the radiation therapy destroyed much of the cancer and likely that there is an on-going war between Sam’s new immune system and the remaining disease. The imagery of this site looks like a solar eclipse – with no activity in the middle, where the radiation focused, but with high activity/avidity around the edges.\n\n\nNew sites\nPerhaps more alarming is that cancer is now active in new areas of Sam’s body. There are three new locations, all of which appear to be within bones (something we have not seen before). Working bottom-up, new sites of cancer are located in Sam’s\n\nleft shin (tibia) slightly below his knee\nhip (right ilium)\nback (T3 vertebrae, between his shoulder blades)\n\nNone of these are currently causing any additional impacts (e.g. bones are still strong, and no nerve impacts). Sam does have some back pain which is likely related to the spot there. These new sites raise questions and there will be a flurry of activity as plans of attack are made."

Next up:\n\nCompleted, Feb 16 morning: CT scan of the T3 vertebrae to assess risk and provide imaging that will assist with treatment planning.\nCompeted, Feb 16: Discussion with with the Orthopedic surgery team to discuss/plan a biopsy of the cancer in Sam’s shin (the easiest of the new sites to access). This was completed by our medical team and it was determined that this biopsy would not be feasible.\nFeb 22: An alternate option is scheduled to biopsy the new cancer in Sam’s back.\nCompleted, Feb 16: Discussion with Radiation Oncologist to discuss new radiation based treatments. Our medical team has been in communication with them and the Radiation team is ready when and if needed.\nOngoing: reduce medications that have kept Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) in-check. Increasing GVHD may help in the battle to kill the cancer … though this will need to be monitored closely to ensure Sam’s good tissues are not damaged.\n\nIt has not even been 48 hours since we received the PET scan results and I hope you can sense that things are moving quickly – action is being taken.\nAlthough there is a lot going on we were also able to get out and enjoy life."

    "section": "This past week’s medical journey",
    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nIt has been a whirlwind of a week filled with anxious waiting, clinic visits most days, pain management, prayers, and the love of family.\nIt was one week ago today that Sam had a biopsy of one of the new disease sites. That procedure went exactly as planned and the tissue was sent to the BC Cancer lab for analysis – though we would not hear about the results until after the weekend.\nFriday we were in clinic for a regular blood levels check and a quick exam. At the time, I was asked if Sam’s symptoms had changed and all I could say was ‘No, he seems to be doing well’. However, that would change over the following days as new pains mounted. I think of these as pain-spikes as they would come on quickly and cause changes in his pain management regime (i.e. drug doses were increased). We are thankful that we have such access to medical advice – though Sam and Tina deserve direct credit for sorting out the latest pain-spike.\n\nThe Finding and The Plan\n\nDuring Tuesday’s visit Dr. Jacob let us all know about the results of the biopsy. The new disease sites are the same cancer (primarily characterized by its INI1 protein deletion). This information was critical to know in order to determine what treatments would be available for Sam. To be honest, the medical toolkit is getting low in options, but at least we still do have options:\n\nFurther chemotherapy is not an option. This cancer has become resistant and that line of therapy would put Sam’s new immune system at risk.\n\nRadiation can be applied but is not a long term solution. We will use it to reduce the burden-of-disease on Sam. In particular it will be used on his T3-vertebrae to prevent potential growth at that site from impinging on Sam’s nerves.\nA drug therapy for Sam has been approved. Nivolumab is used for immunotherapy, though special approval was needed to use it on a BMT recipient. In general terms, this drug will take-the-brakes off Sam’s immune system. Specifically, and as I understand it, this drug disables proteins on the cancer cells that allow them to remain invisible to the immune system. This is a very similar philosophy of treatment as the BMT – to enable the immune system, and in Sam’s case to support his new immune system, to identify and destroy the cancer.\nThe challenge is, until recently we have done the opposite, keeping the immune system brakes on so that the new immune system will not harm Sam’s healthy tissues. The medical team will be watching him closely. The goal: release the immune system to attack while watching for signs that the immune system does not harm Sam – it will be a fine balance.\n\nThere are risks but we are excited to move forward with this option/opportunity to destroy this disease. Sam is excited and these options and expected hospital times, depending on how he tolerates the treatment, could be less difficult than he had imagined.\nToday Sam will start this new immunotherapy treatment. He will be in-hospital for several days to ensure there are no complications. Assuming there are none we will be back at the RMH early next week.\nTomorrow Sam will also make a trip to the BC Cancer Clinic at VGH to have a CT scan which will provide the radiation oncology team the data that they need to complete the planning of their treatments."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

Sam will receive a dose of radiation to each site every day for two weeks (10 business days). Assuming all goes well this will simply mean a short drive to BC Cancer clinic for the treatment and then a return to RMH.\n\nResults and effectiveness\n\nWe are not going to know how any of these treatments are working for some time. It is too soon to tell if the immune therapy is working. Following radiation, we will need to wait a couple weeks for that treatment to take effect. … So we wait.\n\n\nFor now the best indicator of how things are going is with Sam. How he is feeling.

Sam reminded me that we have been here five months longer than expected. He is right. The initial plan if everything had gone as expected/hoped would have seen us go home this past October. Next, the BMT process, should have seen us go home last week. Now, when are we going to get home? Simply, we just do not know.\nIn the meantime, we are enjoying life together. It is a simple life that includes medical care, meals, and time together. When Sam has the energy we get out of the building. Lately, he has enjoyed a trip to a local bookstore. In our room, Tina and I are thrilled when Sam has the energy to connect with friends and play some online games (which he has been able to do a couple times this week). Programs here at the Ronald McDonald House have been helpful. Sam has taken to playing the drums – I don’t know where he gets his rhythm from but he is a natural. I have enjoyed playing and learning a few new things on guitar. Tina has made it to a couple painting classes. We have also been able to connect with a number of other families including playing some board games together.\nWe are encouraged by visitors, Grace and Darren from Prince George, Tina’s Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth originally from England but now in Abbotsford, and Tina’s family: siblings, Nana Mary, and Sam’s cousins are all in the Lower Mainland and we see some of them weekly.\nOne highlight from this past week was that we have moved to a larger room. This will allow us to enjoy our space more including providing some space for some anticipated guests."

He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less. Tina’s family has been close by and have been able to visit. My parents travelled down and were able to be here, support us, and spend some great time with Sam over several days."

    "text": "Next steps\nWe are in a hard place with two potential options for treatment – it is not known which is best or if either will be effective.\n\nOption 1: Rely on the new immune system\nSam’s new immune system is fairly well established (although not completely until about one year after the bone marrow transplant). To date we have not had the opportunity to see what it can do. The previous treatments had side-effects that required steroids to calm/ suppress his immune system so that permanent liver damage could be avoided. If he was taken off the immunosupressants and just let his own (new) immune system work, this option would allow Sam to live and enjoy his life without medications and risk of side-effects. However, we do not know if his new immune system will effectively battle the cancer.\n\n\nOption 2: Resume immune therapy\nThis option would require the use of Nivomulab (an immune therapy drug) again. We know that this drug can make the cancer in Sam’s body ‘visible’ to the immune system. However, this is also the drug that resulted in Sam’s liver being inflamed and the subsequent need for steroids to calm the immune system (Catch-22). If we go this route, the team would use the lessons learned from last time to modify their therapy plan in an attempt to limit side-effects.\n\nIf side-effects can be avoided, this will likely be the more effective treatment.\nIf side-effects cannot be avoided, this treatment could cause permanent harm (eg. the risk of liver failure)."

    "text": "Recap of the last week\n\nCancer war\nIt has been over a week since I last wrote and we have been continuing along two lines of attack against the cancer in Sam’s body.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nEach weekday we have made a trip down to the BC Cancer Centre, about a 10 minute drive away. Sam is/has undergone targeted radiation for the three new disease sites discovered last month. These visits are fairly quick with about 15 minutes needed per site and most of that time is simply setting up/positioning Sam to target the sites the same way each time. Last week treatment of the sites below his knee and on his hip were completed – as these were not near critical organs they received higher doses of radiation per treatment. Treatment of the disease on Sam’s back will be completed at the end of this week. Evaluation of how well the treatments worked will not be for a minimum of 2-3 weeks.\n\nImmune therapy\n\nLast Thursday, Sam was due to have another dose of Nivolumab two weeks following his initial dose. However, this second dose was delayed as his bloodwork suggested that his liver was inflamed and as such it could be dangerous to give another dose. It was a good decision! Over this past weekend Sam has much stronger symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) than we have seen the entire time since receiving his bone marrow transplant (BMT).\n\n\nAs a reminder, the intent of the BMT was to give Sam a new immune system that would recognize the cancer and destroy it. The weeks following the transplant Sam was on a medication to keep the new immune system in-check and reduce symptoms of GVHD. Now that we know that there is more cancer, steps are being taken to release the new immune system to be more aggressive. Essentially, using different drugs, we went from applying the brakes to the immune system to adding fuel to it. The goal: activate/jump-start the immune system to attack the cancer. Of course doing this has the potential to unleash the immune system to also attack Sam’s healthy tissues.\n\n\nThis past weekend Sam had intense rashes and evidence that the GVHD was not only active on the outside of his body but also the inside (e.g. loss of taste, increased liver enzymes). The GVHD seemed to reach a peak on the weekend. Recent bloodwork seems to align with the symptoms we have been observing. If Sam’s immune system continues to settle back down we will likely continue with this line of treatment.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral living\nSam’s life is pretty simple: watching too much YouTube, and when he has more energy, he reads, plays video games (only rarely able to sit up to play on his PC), and occasionally reviews some studies. Lately, his activity has been limited to short walks, mostly around the RMH. He also enjoys visiting with people, though his capacity can often be low causing visits to be short (e.g. 30 minutes). Despite the length of this journey and current challenges Sam still maintains a positive attitude with statements like: “I love my life.”, “I am so happy”, “We have a great family”.\nOur parental pride swelled earlier this week. A boy here at the RMH, I’ll call him B., is about five years old and has looked up to Sam. B. was having a hard week and mad at the world – Sam decided to brighten his day. Sam chose a lego set which I purchased when I was out. Sam was able to give it to him the next day and also spent some time helping him assemble it. B. was thrilled! So great that Sam took the opportunity to care for this young man!\nWe continue to enjoy visits with family. Tina’s family members, who live in the region, try to make a point of being here each week. We look forward to seeing them on their usual days.\nWe also love to see friends as they are able to come through. This past week it was great to see Jess and John with Kate and John (Jr.)."

I am thankful that these boys were able see Sam when he was up and when he was down and simply accept him where he was at.\nWe also love the times we can connect with family, here at the RMH, at their homes, and at a hockey game.\n\n\nHockey\nSam has really been enjoying hockey during this difficult period. He looks forward to watching games. Since I last wrote we were able to attend two.\nFirst, we attended the WHL’s Vancouver Giants versus Kelowna Rockets. This was a special family time as we were gifted box seats to the game. Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the three of us plus Chase there.\nThis past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with a party atmosphere at the arena!"

Preliminary results may be available in clinic that afternoon though the full report may have to wait until Friday. Results of this scan will dictate next steps. If the results are positive then we can proceed with our preferred treatment option: to simply keep doing what we have been doing over the last number of weeks – let the immune system do its work and wait-and-see. If results are more challenging we will discuss options with the team here at BC Children’s."

    "section": "Cancer war",
    "text": "Cancer war\nSam has summarized this the past two PET scans in the following way (parap hrased):\n\nThe PET scan in February was like someone dumped a load of bricks on me.\nThis last PET scan was like someone removed all the bricks but then threw a single one at me.\n\nSam is great spirits. As the impacts of radiation therapy are behind him, and the effects of GVHD1 are lessening he is seeing his energy return. Today he wants to go grocery shopping with me.\n\nReview\nThe previous PET, back on Feb 14, provided really hard news. Following months of seeing a new immune system be established in Sam (Nov. - Feb) that imaging showed three new disease sites – it seemed that all of the previous efforts were for naught and that we were losing the cancer war. Despite all of the efforts of the BMT to establishing a new immune system, it did not seem to be effective at beating back the cancer.\nSince the discovery of the new sites Sam has received immunotherapy (via the drug Nivomulab) as well as targeted radiation treatment to the new disease centers. The radiation therapy was straight forward and ended a couple weeks ago. With the immune therapy Sam was only able to have a single dose of the Nivomulab which triggered more GVHD2 than he had seen during his BMT3. Although this GVHD was not physically comfortable (e.g. hot rashes, GI4 effects) it was mentally comforting – if the immune system was attacking healthy tissue it meant that it was most likely also attacking the cancer. Most recently, the immune system started getting dangerously out of control by stressing Sam’s liver. In response, he was started on some steroids to put the brakes on his immune system and bring it back in-check.\nThis sets the stage for the PET scan this past Friday (April 5).\n\n\nPET scan results\nApril 5th scan\n\nRadiated sites\nWe have clear wins! No cancer was detectable in the three sites discovered back in Feb. The cancer in his T3 vertebrae, hip, and shin has been wiped out by the radiation therapy.\n\n\nCentral mass\nThe mass in the center of Sam’s chest, the one that brought us down here to start with, is stable. There is increased metabolic activity in the area but it remains the same size as previous – and potentially a little smaller. What is exciting about this is that the only thing keeping this site in-check would have been Sam’s immune system. The fact that this site is stable suggests that the immune system is able to battle whatever cancer is still in this area.\n\n\nChallenges\nA single new site has been located. The new site is located in Sam’s liver. For now we have to assume that this is new disease site (i.e. the same type of cancer in a new location). However, it is possible that is something else. The liver is a big organ, one that is hard to do surgery on, but this new site is superficial (near the surface) just below Sam’s lower rib on the right side. Given where this site is we are hoping that a biopsy can be completed this coming week."

Nana Mary, Uncles Kevin and Cal were also able to come in the afternoon that we received the PET scan results.\nYesterday, Tina and I were able to visit with Brian, Beth, David, and Luke. A definitely highlight from that visit was seeing Sam have energy to talk with his friend!\n\n\nTragedy\nYesterday’s visits were filled with joy. But the day was also filled with sorrow.

After a couple of days our own home was ready to return to.\nDuring this break it was most encouraging for me to simply watch our boy! He loved being home and jumped full into life there:\n\nSam loved connecting with friends.\nHe chose to jump right back into school despite having missed the last third of grade 9 and almost all of grade 10. Many thanks to the staff and students at Cedars who welcomed Sam back in and allowed him to engage with his academics.\nHe pushed hard to catch up on a couple topics often spending 2-3 hours a day on homework. … Honestly he had seemed to have more energy than I did.\nThis last Friday, after writing a three hour math test during the day, Sam even attended the school dance. His muscles are still sore from having had a great time with friends and dancing the evening away!\n\nTina and I were able to connect with various friends.

Sam has had such great energy lately. He has been waking up at the same time as me and we have spent our days together – talking, playing, reading, and even sharing the chores.\nIn the early morning just over a year ago, on April 18, 2023, Sam arrived at BC Children’s hospital. Oh, how far he as come along this incredible journey of seeing him return to health. He is by no means out-of-the-woods yet, but now he can “walk-in-the-woods” with us. Sam is joyful, he has increasing energy and stamina, and his courageous attitude seems to have no limits.\nOne year ago Tina and Sam had been sent down by air ambulance and were admitted directly to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). I arrived about twelve hours later. Sam remained in PICU for the next number of days while the medical team stabilized him, and initial imaging and biopsies were completed. It would be 10 days later that the biopsy reports were completed and Sam’s cancer was identified. Once identified, we knew we would be travelling a challenging road – one that was not mapped by any procedures or protocols that the medical team could follow."

    "text": "Major Milestones\nWhat a journey this has been. Sam has been through three eras of cancer treatment: 1) chemotherapy, 2) BMT, and now 3) immune therapy. Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy. Below is provided a quick review of the major milestones.\n\nChemotherapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\nApril 17\nAn alarming x-ray in Prince George provided evidence that Sam needed urgent care at BCCH.\n\n\nApril 18\nAir Ambulance in the early morning and admission to BCCH’s PICU.\n\n\nApril 22\nTransfer to BCCH Oncology Ward (T8).\n\n\nApril 28\nDiagnosis of a extremely rare form of lymphoma.\n\n\nApril 29\nChemotherapy is initiated. Sam will receive an additional 6 full rounds of chemotherapy taking him into October.\n\n\nJune 2\nFollowing his second round of chemotherapy Sam was discharged from the hospital for the first time. This marks the beginning of our family life at RMH. The next months we would visit the oncology clinic regularly. When it was time for each round of chemotherapy we would check into the ward for about 5 days.\n\n\nJuly 14\nPlans for a bone marrow transplant were initiated.

    "text": "Travel log\nThe initial idea to travel was presented last Wednesday, April 17. However, actual travel plans were dependent on metrics on Sam’s bloodwork that would allow the medical team to decide if it would be safe for Sam to travel. Specifically, if Sam’s numbers were not good on the Friday, we check again on the Monday, and if they were not good then the trip would be cancelled. So to keep things flexible we chose to drive. As a family we have always done road trips and Sam was looking forward to this pilgrimage drive home.\n\nDay 1 – Travel\nSunday, April 21\nWe got away from Vancouver at a good time. It was a cool cloudy day with some showers heading into the Fraser Canyon. We had a great early lunch at Horsting’s Farm near Cache Creek. In the afternoon we stopped to see Renee near Williams Lake. Refreshed and fed we travelled on arriving at my parents as the sun was setting.\nWe received a loving welcome from Mom and Dad and all of us loved seeing Sam reconnect with Buddy – his dog was crazy excited to see him! We were also able to catch the last two periods of the first Vancouver vs. Nashville playoff game.\n\n\nDay 2 – Family\nMonday\nThis was really the only day that we had any sort of plan which was to make family our priority. The earlier part of the day was spent with my parents and the evening with Tom, Margaret, Daniel and Alex. Good times connecting, talking, and playing games together.\n\n\nDay 3 – School\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam loved reconnecting with his friends at school and later at youth group!\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nWe let this day be driven by Sam and how he was feeling – he was feeling good. Mid-morning Sam had a great idea of visiting his friends at school over the lunch break. It was so good to see him simply slip into life at the school. We ended up spending the entire afternoon there as Sam joined in to classes. Tina and I connected with staff and a number of friends as parents rolled in for afterschool pickup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4 – Whirlwind\nWednesday\nWednesday was more of a whirlwind. Sam had an appointment at the hospital pediatric clinic. This was our first connection with the Prince George team. Although they do not specialize in cancer treatment it was good to see how much ca be taken care of at the hospital back home. In the afternoon we squeezed in some visits with friends and dinner with the grandparents. In the evening Sam was able to attend youth group at the church!\n\n\n\n\nDay 5 – Return to Vancouver\nThursday\nWe had to head back to Vancouver. It was a great road trip. Sam is looking forward to the day when he can be the driver. In the meantime he watched the road and acted as a good copilot.\nIt was a great first trip home and hopefully our next one will be in the near future and with more days at home."

We have we been checking in with the hospital clinic and so far the metrics associated with Sam’s liver numbers are going the right direction. This suggests that the liver is healing/ becoming less inflamed.\nThis week we have a few items on the agenda: a) Clinic check-ins; b) Ultrasound of the liver to verify that the non-cancerous mass there is either stable or improving; and c) PET scan (possibly). The PET scan is the big item as it will show us the status of the cancer in Sam’s body. Results of the PET will also strongly inform Sam’s next treatment(s).\nThis journey has been long and we are tired. This past weekend family facilitated giving me a break. Tina and Sam stayed with Mary and the Fricker family (Tina’s sister’s family) giving me almost 24 hours off. It was great to have that time without responsibilities.\nSam remains positive and continues to get stronger. Tina and I are glad to see this. However, we cannot escape feelings of needing-to-be-vigilant and anxiousness about what could be happening undetected – the results of the PET scan this week will be very helpful."

Side effects are becoming dangerous as Sam’s liver is inflamed. In order to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam’s immune system needs to be brought back to a regulated state.

Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.\nWe are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam.

Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at minimum the day leading up to them are intense. It is weird because the scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is happening. They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that we fear. To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for. This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.\nThe results of this last scan, like many others, has mixed news.\n\nCancer status\nThe good news is that since Feb 5th there are no new disease sites.\nThe difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam’s chest remains and has grown a small amount. The previous scan, April 5, showed no detectable change at that site and so to have this new growth strongly suggests that the cancer is active there. Options for treatment are limited and it is unknown if they will be effective.\n\n\nLiver status\nThe previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active site in Sam’s liver could be cancer. This has been ruled out via biopsy. We have known for sometime that Sam’s liver has been stressed due to side-effects of his immune therapy treatment causing his immune system to become deregulated. Latest metrics of Sam’s liver health have been improving. Recent ultrasound of the liver shows a minor increase in size. The Doctors want to continue monitoring this mass as it is not an urgent priority right now."

One evening Sam led our family for a larger walk, one that I did not know he was capable of, down to Cambie Village about 1.5kms away. We had some great ice cream before walking back. This was an epic evening for our family.\nOver this past weekend we were able to join some of the Frickers and the Townsend side of the family to experience the animals at Aldor Farms near Ft. Langley. I loved watching Sam take some time to groom Rob, a huge Percheron work horse.\nYesterday, we celebrated Mothers Day. Ronald McDonald House put on a beautiful brunch. In the evening, we took in the Canucks vs. Oilers hockey game (which Sam mostly slept through due to being tired from his big farm day Saturday)."

In an attempt to answer that, last week Sam had a contrast CT of his chest, one week of being off immune suppression, and he will be scheduled for additional CT scans in the weeks ahead. He will also continue with regular PET scans to ensure that the cancer has not moved to new locations in his body. The great news is that there has been no detectable significant change in the size of the cancerous mass1. The last known change in the disease centre was between Feb. 14 and April 5.\nFor Sam the downside of being off immunosuppression is that symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) have started to return. However, he knows that these pains most likely mean that the cancer is also being fought. I don’t know if it will stick but our current motto is:\n\nBring on the pain, kill the cancer, live life!!\n\nTo sum-up the current situation – Sam is now in a wait-and-see period. Our hope is that his immune system will, at minimum, hold the cancer back, and at best remove it. We are thrilled that it seems the cancer has not progressed. We are hopeful that the current plan could finally work. We also fear that the cancer will change and develop again. So now we wait and we try to live life with, and in spite of cancer.\nMoving forward we will continue with Sam’s regular bloodwork and every few weeks complete further scans (CT and/or PET scans)."

Steps are being taken to manage what all indications suggest is lymphoma. Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

Past research suggest that these drugs could be effective at 1) interrupting a key metabolic pathway in the cancer cells, and 2) disable some of the cancer’s defenses that allow it to hide from the immune system.\nLast Friday we were hoping to see Sam start on this modified immunotherapy drug treatment plan, but it was not safe to do so. Since receiving his BMT1 Sam has had some level of GVHD2. One ongoing effect of GVHD is that fluid has built up around his heart (measured using an echocardiogram). To date this has not impacted his heart function. The challenge and safety concern is that the new immunotherapy treatment will likely intensify GVHD impacts that could put his heart at risk.\nSo instead of treating the cancer, last week Sam was started on a steroid to reduce GVHD effects. Yesterday, a repeat echocardiogram and blood metrics suggest that this GVHD treatment is working and this should allow Sam to start on the immunetherapy/cancer-treatment later this week."

    "text": "Reflecting on April 25\nGiven that the days have been hard lately. It is incredible to say that Sam had a great day yesterday. He was himself, he had energy to talk, even played a video game for almost an hour! Yes, I celebrate when Sam is able to play video games!\nSam’s afternoon and ours was filled with love as family arrived. My parents, Gram and Papa C, drove in from Prince George, and Kevin and Shannon, Tina’s sister, were here from Edmonton. My parents had a good visit with Sam and we look forward to seeing them over the next couple days. Uncle Kev and Auntie Shan had a good visit with Sam in the evening when, as always, Kevin attempted his jokes trying to get Sam to crack; this round went to Sam – though I definitely had some good laughs."

The team was not able to draw the routine blood sample from Sam this morning. I am not sure if they will try again … or draw blood with needles.\nThanks for an great day yesterday, as Sam was alert and interactive, and we felt the love of family. … It is awesome to receive love and notes from afar. It is next level to receive it as a hug!"

    "text": "Hi friends,\nThe last 48 hours have been a whirlwind, and we are where we need to be.\nSam is now at BC Children’s hospital, and Tina and I are able to stay in the room with him. Steps are being taken to manage what all indications suggest is lymphoma. Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR (short version)\nYesterday: surgery for tissue samples followed by pain management. In the weeks to come, Sam will be here at BC Children Hospital as he is treated for what is assumed to be lymphoma.\n--\n\n\nFull version\nHi all,\nYesterday was a big day for Sam. He had the surgery to complete a series of biopsies. These included the removal of a lymph node at the base of his neck, a lumbar puncture, a bone marrow sample from the top of his hip, and establishing a PICC (described here) to facilitate ongoing blood work and upcoming intravenous drug delivery. All the procedures went well. Dr. Webber, completed the lymph node removal and said it went “Perfectly”. This was all done before noon. The biggest challenge of the day has been pain management, but Sam has been a trooper.\nThe staff here continue to be amazing, always taking the time to answer any of Sam’s questions, and making complex biology and bio-chemistry understandable. It is honestly amazing to hear Sam explain his disease to others – he gets it, understands it, and given the situation is very glad to be here.\nNext steps are not totally clear. We are working with the understanding/assumption that Sam has lymphoma (one possibility described here) As of April 23, we still do not know what type of cancer this is. The signs all point that way (e.g. X-ray and CT scan), but this will not be totally confirmed until the tissue samples are processed. Here is what we are currently expecting:\n\nSam will start a round of drug treatment, as soon as later today, and specific treatments will be refined following the analysis of his tissue samples\nSam is currently in the ICU, and we expect him to be here for the next number of days after which, he will be transferred to the oncology unit just a few floors above where he will remain a patient for three weeks or so (timing of stay will all depend on tests).\nTina and I will be able to check into the Ronald McDonald House here on hospital campus on Sunday. This will give us a home base, we will also be able to continue staying in the room with Sam.\n\nMany thanks to all of Sam’s friends and teachers, and all of our friends and family. We love to hear from you. We may not get back to you right away but know your messages are encouraging to us. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will try to answer them either directly or in a following update.\n\n\nQ&A\n\nHow is Tina doing?\n\nShe is actually great. She has been working so hard advocating for Sam’s health over the last months, trying to get the bottom of why he has been sick. Now, she can relax as Sam is where he needs to be, receiving the medical care that he needs. She also loves the medical world, she is in her element here. Our biggest challenge for Tina will be to ensure she is properly fed, especially given her dietary restrictions. We will need to find a new normal here.\n\nHow can we help / Let us know if we can help.\n\nHearing from you is currently the best. As noted, we might not be able to get back to you right away, but all of your notes are encouraging. Tina and I have literally had tears-of-joy reading them.\n\n\nThanks again for your prayers and support,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR\nWe are in a waiting period, and as results from Sam’s biopsies trickle in, we have some knowledge of what the disease is not. Our hearts are peaceful and we have been filled with messages of love and prayer from around the world!\n\n\nReflections on April 21, 2023\nHow long have we been here? As I write this, it is only the beginning of day four and I am writing about day 3, so much has happened.\nYesterday, was … a beautiful day. Sam was far more comfortable, being another day away from his biopsy surgery. It was wonderful to watch him sleep and nap on and off through the day. This time of rest also powered him up to visit with family. It was also great to see Tina catch up on some much-needed sleep.\n\nPhysical Health\nMedically, it was generally a quiet day. No new tests, just the routine of checking vitals, checking blood chemistry, and taking medicines (e.g. pain management from the previous surgery). We are in waiting phase. The lab has not finished processing the tissue samples taken April 20th. Despite not knowing much yet the medical team continues to communicate. The best news was that we now know that the disease is:\n\nnot in the central nervous system\nnot in his bone marrow.\n\nIt might be a quiet weekend as lab results may not come back until mid-next week. So we wait as a family, and the medical team waits with us. One might think this is frustrating, but it is not, rather it is a peaceful and strategic waiting. Once the tests come back the doctors will be very intentional on how to manage Sam’s health. So we wait, for the right understanding, and the subsequent right treatment plan.\n\n\nSoul Health\nWow, what a good day! We have heard from so many friends, family, some of whom we have not connected with for years, but this challenging time is pulling our people together. Thank you for reaching out to us, conveying your care, telling us your stories, or simply what is happening in your world. We are supported by your words, your love, and your prayers.\nPeople around the world are praying – it’s awesome. Friends, family, and their friends and families, bible study and prayer groups; from Prince George, across the province, across the continent, and as far away as Zambia!\nWe have also had some amazing face-to-face visits/care.\n\nA friend anticipated our needs and showed up with a bag of groceries and goodies picked especially for Tina and her dietary needs / requirements.\nA providential visit with the Schellenbergs with whom we have shared so much life and adventure. What are the chances that they just happened to be in the area this weekend! For those who don’t know them, they live in Saskatchewan.\nSam had a great visit with his cousin Chris, Uncle Cal, and Auntie Tricia.\n\nTo wrap up this post, please know that we feel cared for in soul and body. Although we do not know what treatment for Sam will look like, we are in a peaceful place. That might change, we may have challenges ahead, but we are bolstered by your love, we are carried.\nLove to you all!\nColin"

Thank you to the ICU team and their vigilant care of our boy. Sam is now under the care of the Oncology team. Things are quieter here as medical policies do not require constant monitoring. The view is also nicer, the ICU window looked at the side of another building, now from the 8th floor the view is across Vancouver, out to Burnaby, SFU, and the mountains beyond.\n… I was going to add a picture but as the rain comes down there are no views in Vancouver this morning.\nWe were encouraged by visits:\n\nThe Smiths, dear friends who we originally bonded with while working in Guatemala with CMU’s Outtatown program, came over from Vancouver Island.\nSam’s sweetheart of a cousin Jayme (2.5 years) delivered her hand-made card supported by mom Amanda, Auntie Tricia, and Uncle Cal.

    "text": "Reflections of April 23, 2023\nYesterday was a quiet day with challenges.\n\nCancer, but what type are we dealing with?\nYesterday morning, Tina and I spoke with Dr. Chang who has been taking the lead in Sam’s case. I was really glad to have this conversation, to know what Dr. Chang was thinking, and strategies going forward … but this one also hurt. The major challenge for the medical team is that they still do not know exactly what they are dealing with. This is a cancer, but the specific type of cancer remains unknown.\nGiven that there are unknowns around the type of cancer, there are also unknowns about how it will behave and potentially where it is. Sam needs to have a full-body scan, if an opening in the schedule at the BC Cancer Clinic can be found, and timing on this is essential. The scan needs to happen before treatment starts and the team can only wait so long (i.e. treatment needs to start this week).\n\n\nOn needles\nOver the last month, Sam has not had a good time with needles. Really, I think we can all relate – getting a shot, or having blood taken, is not something any of us enjoy. Sam has taken them on, with blood test after blood test. To make things worse, as Sam entered the hospital system he had to have IV medications, many of which failed. In the last nine IVs he experienced six failed attempts, and three were initially established successful; of those one was accidentally pulled during surgery, one blew, and a last one remains. All this to say needles cause a level of anxiety.\nSam has had a number of days of grace. The PICC line provides easy access, but last night it stopped working, they could not draw blood. If it does not work, then drawing blood via needles will be needed. In a few texts last night, we asked for prayer for this.\n\n\nVictories and comforts\n\nThe small things really do matter! Many thanks to our nurse Pam who made sure that Sam was able to get into the shower today. He came out clean, refreshed, and feeling human!\nI didn’t finish the needle story:\n\nThe doctor changes the order regarding taking blood. So no need for blood last night!\nThis morning I came into the room at 4:45 and both Sam and Tina were full of joy. Sam had just had his blood taken, and no needles were used. The PICC line was working again.\n\nSo where was I coming in from at 5:00am? We now have a home away from home at the Ronald McDonald House, where I had a comfortable, and mostly full night’s sleep.\n\n\n\nNeeds and concerns\nCurrently:\n\nFirm diagnosis of the type of cancer. This will significantly inform treatment.\nPET scan to determine where this disease is and where it is not. Timing is essential on this – the sooner the better.\nThat Sam’s PICC line would continue to function. Ideally, that it could also be used for treatment … either adjustments are needed or another PICC will need to be established as the current one is not ‘centrally located’ (not exactly where they need it to be)."

    "text": "One week ago today, Sam went in for the X-ray that started the chain of events that has led us here. Time is warped for us; I expect this is a common experience for all of us in times when life is intense; where experiential time does not seem to link up with chronological time. Needless to say, life has been intense.\nIt is amazing the range of emotion that can happen as your child sleeps. Over this last week I have watch with joy and contentment as Sam slept peacefully, to another extreme filled with waves of fear and anxiety that he hasn’t woken up (yesterday). In the later afternoon yesterday, we stepped away from Sam’s bedside, where he continued to sleep, to visit with Cal and Tricia. My day was made when we got back, he was not only awake, but he was up and out of bed, sitting in a chair. This was sweet joy, relief, and peace. He spent the next 1-2 hours chatting with his Aunt and Uncle!"

I can’t say that it is perfect, but it is all he needs for now – no additional needles have been needed.\nMany thanks to Sam’s nurses. A special shout out to Pam – your efforts with Sam made my day yesterday!\nSam has had such a great attitude! Physically, he has not felt good, with fatigue and sometimes nausea. Mentally/emotionally he is doing really well. It is not uncommon to here him say This is great or I’m so happy. He knows he is where he needs to be; he is on a road to healing."

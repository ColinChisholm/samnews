We love how honest she is with us, that she shares what she knows and how she lets us know what she does not know. In our meeting, she told us about Sam’s latest chest X-ray – the purpose of which was to rule out the potential for pneumonia related to Sam’s cold. There was also enough information in the image that Dr. Cheng could provide a preliminary report: the tumour is smaller than shown in the previous CT scan (taken after round 1 of chemo). We are headed in the right direction – round 1 saw a reduction in the cancerous mass, and round 2 appears to be doing the same! We will know better in with the next scan in a couple weeks when a scan will be done to image the cancer itself.\nAs to what the next steps will be following this round of chemo – that is simply unknown."

Yesterday, was quieter in Sam’s room. As per doctor’s recommendations we reduced his visitor hours. I spent most of the day with Sam, less a couple hours, when Nana sat with him. Outside the room, Tina and Mary (Nana) had a great visit with Tina’s nieces Amanda and Jayme, and Jane, and her brother Cal.\nIt has also been nice to seen the familar faces of Jarod and Erin S. as we either meet with them or simply bump into them in the halls here."

We will not know how the cancer has responded to this treatment for another week-and-a-half. Once the full therapy cycle is complete the team here will scan for changes.\nHomesickness and boredom. Sam has been a champ making the best of his time here. Yesterday, Sam and I had a great conversation about home, that we miss it, and we imagined/ dreamed of what we love about home from simple things of regular life, to friends, to dreaming of what we would like to do when we return. Longing for home and feeling trapped in this hospital ward may become significant challenges in the days ahead."

Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR (short version)\nYesterday: surgery for tissue samples followed by pain management. In the weeks to come, Sam will be here at BC Children Hospital as he is treated for what is assumed to be lymphoma.\n--\n\n\nFull version\nHi all,\nYesterday was a big day for Sam. He had the surgery to complete a series of biopsies. These included the removal of a lymph node at the base of his neck, a lumbar puncture, a bone marrow sample from the top of his hip, and establishing a PICC (described here) to facilitate ongoing blood work and upcoming intravenous drug delivery. All the procedures went well. Dr. Webber, completed the lymph node removal and said it went “Perfectly”. This was all done before noon. The biggest challenge of the day has been pain management, but Sam has been a trooper.\nThe staff here continue to be amazing, always taking the time to answer any of Sam’s questions, and making complex biology and bio-chemistry understandable. It is honestly amazing to hear Sam explain his disease to others – he gets it, understands it, and given the situation is very glad to be here.\nNext steps are not totally clear. We are working with the understanding/assumption that Sam has lymphoma (one possibility described here) As of April 23, we still do not know what type of cancer this is. The signs all point that way (e.g. X-ray and CT scan), but this will not be totally confirmed until the tissue samples are processed. Here is what we are currently expecting:\n\nSam will start a round of drug treatment, as soon as later today, and specific treatments will be refined following the analysis of his tissue samples\nSam is currently in the ICU, and we expect him to be here for the next number of days after which, he will be transferred to the oncology unit just a few floors above where he will remain a patient for three weeks or so (timing of stay will all depend on tests).\nTina and I will be able to check into the Ronald McDonald House here on hospital campus on Sunday. This will give us a home base, we will also be able to continue staying in the room with Sam.\n\nMany thanks to all of Sam’s friends and teachers, and all of our friends and family. We love to hear from you. We may not get back to you right away but know your messages are encouraging to us. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will try to answer them either directly or in a following update.\n\n\nQ&A\n\nHow is Tina doing?\n\nShe is actually great. She has been working so hard advocating for Sam’s health over the last months, trying to get the bottom of why he has been sick. Now, she can relax as Sam is where he needs to be, receiving the medical care that he needs. She also loves the medical world, she is in her element here. Our biggest challenge for Tina will be to ensure she is properly fed, especially given her dietary restrictions. We will need to find a new normal here.\n\nHow can we help / Let us know if we can help.\n\nHearing from you is currently the best. As noted, we might not be able to get back to you right away, but all of your notes are encouraging. Tina and I have literally had tears-of-joy reading them.\n\n\nThanks again for your prayers and support,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "TLDR\nWe are in a waiting period, and as results from Sam’s biopsies trickle in, we have some knowledge of what the disease is not. Our hearts are peaceful and we have been filled with messages of love and prayer from around the world!\n\n\nReflections on April 21, 2023\nHow long have we been here? As I write this, it is only the beginning of day four and I am writing about day 3, so much has happened.\nYesterday, was … a beautiful day. Sam was far more comfortable, being another day away from his biopsy surgery. It was wonderful to watch him sleep and nap on and off through the day. This time of rest also powered him up to visit with family. It was also great to see Tina catch up on some much-needed sleep.\n\nPhysical Health\nMedically, it was generally a quiet day. No new tests, just the routine of checking vitals, checking blood chemistry, and taking medicines (e.g. pain management from the previous surgery). We are in waiting phase. The lab has not finished processing the tissue samples taken April 20th. Despite not knowing much yet the medical team continues to communicate. The best news was that we now know that the disease is:\n\nnot in the central nervous system\nnot in his bone marrow.\n\nIt might be a quiet weekend as lab results may not come back until mid-next week. So we wait as a family, and the medical team waits with us. One might think this is frustrating, but it is not, rather it is a peaceful and strategic waiting. Once the tests come back the doctors will be very intentional on how to manage Sam’s health. So we wait, for the right understanding, and the subsequent right treatment plan.\n\n\nSoul Health\nWow, what a good day! We have heard from so many friends, family, some of whom we have not connected with for years, but this challenging time is pulling our people together. Thank you for reaching out to us, conveying your care, telling us your stories, or simply what is happening in your world. We are supported by your words, your love, and your prayers.\nPeople around the world are praying – it’s awesome. Friends, family, and their friends and families, bible study and prayer groups; from Prince George, across the province, across the continent, and as far away as Zambia!\nWe have also had some amazing face-to-face visits/care.\n\nA friend anticipated our needs and showed up with a bag of groceries and goodies picked especially for Tina and her dietary needs / requirements.\nA providential visit with the Schellenbergs with whom we have shared so much life and adventure. What are the chances that they just happened to be in the area this weekend! For those who don’t know them, they live in Saskatchewan.\nSam had a great visit with his cousin Chris, Uncle Cal, and Auntie Tricia.\n\nTo wrap up this post, please know that we feel cared for in soul and body. Although we do not know what treatment for Sam will look like, we are in a peaceful place. That might change, we may have challenges ahead, but we are bolstered by your love, we are carried.\nLove to you all!\nColin"

The major challenge for the medical team is that they still do not know exactly what they are dealing with. This is a cancer, but the specific type of cancer remains unknown.\nGiven that there are unknowns around the type of cancer, there are also unknowns about how it will behave and potentially where it is. Sam needs to have a full-body scan, if an opening in the schedule at the BC Cancer Clinic can be found, and timing on this is essential. The scan needs to happen before treatment starts and the team can only wait so long (i.e. treatment needs to start this week).\n\n\nOn needles\nOver the last month, Sam has not had a good time with needles. Really, I think we can all relate – getting a shot, or having blood taken, is not something any of us enjoy. Sam has taken them on, with blood test after blood test. To make things worse, as Sam entered the hospital system he had to have IV medications, many of which failed. In the last nine IVs he experienced six failed attempts, and three were initially established successful; of those one was accidentally pulled during surgery, one blew, and a last one remains. All this to say needles cause a level of anxiety.\nSam has had a number of days of grace. The PICC line provides easy access, but last night it stopped working, they could not draw blood. If it does not work, then drawing blood via needles will be needed. In a few texts last night, we asked for prayer for this.\n\n\nVictories and comforts\n\nThe small things really do matter! Many thanks to our nurse Pam who made sure that Sam was able to get into the shower today. He came out clean, refreshed, and feeling human!\nI didn’t finish the needle story:\n\nThe doctor changes the order regarding taking blood. So no need for blood last night!\nThis morning I came into the room at 4:45 and both Sam and Tina were full of joy. Sam had just had his blood taken, and no needles were used. The PICC line was working again.\n\nSo where was I coming in from at 5:00am? We now have a home away from home at the Ronald McDonald House, where I had a comfortable, and mostly full night’s sleep.\n\n\n\nNeeds and concerns\nCurrently:\n\nFirm diagnosis of the type of cancer. This will significantly inform treatment.\nPET scan to determine where this disease is and where it is not. Timing is essential on this – the sooner the better.\nThat Sam’s PICC line would continue to function. Ideally, that it could also be used for treatment … either adjustments are needed or another PICC will need to be established as the current one is not ‘centrally located’ (not exactly where they need it to be)."

    "text": "One week ago today, Sam went in for the X-ray that started the chain of events that has led us here. Time is warped for us; I expect this is a common experience for all of us in times when life is intense; where experiential time does not seem to link up with chronological time. Needless to say, life has been intense.\nIt is amazing the range of emotion that can happen as your child sleeps. Over this last week I have watch with joy and contentment as Sam slept peacefully, to another extreme filled with waves of fear and anxiety that he hasn’t woken up (yesterday). In the later afternoon yesterday, we stepped away from Sam’s bedside, where he continued to sleep, to visit with Cal and Tricia. My day was made when we got back, he was not only awake, but he was up and out of bed, sitting in a chair. This was sweet joy, relief, and peace. He spent the next 1-2 hours chatting with his Aunt and Uncle!"

Many thanks to the Drs. who pushed hard to get him in, we know that you have worked hard!\nSam’s PICC, is working … enough. I can’t say that it is perfect, but it is all he needs for now – no additional needles have been needed.\nMany thanks to Sam’s nurses. A special shout out to Pam – your efforts with Sam made my day yesterday!\nSam has had such a great attitude! Physically, he has not felt good, with fatigue and sometimes nausea. Mentally/emotionally he is doing really well. It is not uncommon to here him say This is great or I’m so happy. He knows he is where he needs to be; he is on a road to healing."

My parents, Gram and Papa C, drove in from Prince George, and Kevin and Shannon, Tina’s sister, were here from Edmonton. My parents had a good visit with Sam and we look forward to seeing them over the next couple days. Uncle Kev and Auntie Shan had a good visit with Sam in the evening when, as always, Kevin attempted his jokes trying to get Sam to crack; this round went to Sam – though I definitely had some good laughs."

It is expected that BC Cancer Clinic will be able to identify the disease.\nHowever, we may not be able to wait. Initial treatment steps may need to be taken before the diagnosis is in.

    "text": "Reflections on April 28\nThis date will be significant to use for the rest of our lives – that day we received a diagnosis and the initiation of treatment.\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nIn the morning the lead care team (Oncologist, Clinical Care Nurse, and Social Worker) met with us – the three of us to start, and then Tina and I for the details. Finally we have a diagnosis, Sam’s cancer has been identified. We have been looking forward to this as a diagnosis leads to a plan … if you know what it is, you can know how to treat it. We all wish it was that simple.\nSam has an extremely rare form of cancer. It is a blood-based cancer mostly located in the lymphatic system. The name of the disease is almost as long as the first two sentences in this paragraph. We know what to call it, we know where it is, the team will treat it. However, the treatment plan will be week-to-week, and as treatment phases are completed, additional steps will be taken to evaluate the response/impact on the disease.\nPhase 1 of treatment has started, a round of chemotherapy, and we know the plan for this week.\nI have to add that Sam is a champ! Today’s needle count tallied to 4 including the addition a new IV line.\n\n\nSurrounded by love\n\nMy Mom and Dad were here and were have to have a good time talking with Sam while Tina and I met with the medical team. I am glad they were here. It was good to share tears with them.\nRhoda and Dave, had a great conversation with Sam, and gifted him with comics and games\nTina had a great call with sister.\nMany thanks to all of you for your notes of support, well-wishes, and prayers! Your words, stories, encouragement, and solidarity with us are amazing.\n\n\n\nNeeds, concerns and victories\n\nWe are all walking in the dark. Our family and the Drs. Pray for wisdom to simply see the next step.\nWe need to see the cancer respond to the treatment. It is unknown, how this cancer will respond, or how it may adapt/ resist.\nChemotherapy, is intense, and some of the chemicals are literally poison. We have entered a world of trade-offs. The disease must die, but the treatment has dangers and significant potential side-effects.\n\nWe will count the small victories and joys\n\nSam took on numerous pokes/needles like a champ.\nSam’s PICC worked … most of the time.\nOut of bed. Sam’ has been sick and mostly bed-ridden. He enjoyed some time out of bed sitting up in a chair.\nIt was a puppy therapy day today. If you know Sam you know he loves dogs.\n\n\n\nMeditation\nThere are two passages of scripture that are constantly in my mind. Two passages that reflect in-part where I am at.\n\nHe guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; Psalm 23\n\n\nif you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” “ ‘If you can’?”said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” Mark 9:14f"

This is a big deal. Blood chemistry is every four hours, and without the PICC it would mean needles for every sample. Today, needles to draw blood were not necessary.\nOn needles. Sam gets a small injection every 12 hours. Our nursing team might be in competition to see who can deliver with the least pain. Of the last three needles Sam felt one, a bit; didn’t feel one at all; and was tickled by a third. Wow, if we can keep this pattern going that would be amazing. Happy for what we have now.\nSam was able to complete the intake of his intense chemotherapy chemicals. If you have ever been in the health care system for more than a couple days you likely know the importance of … movements. Alex, Sam’s nurse, literally danced for joy as this health moment. The timing of this was critical to allow for the taking of the drugs. Also, if it had taken any longer Sam might have needed a yet another new IV."

We made plans to start a Harry Potter movie marathon.\nSam was hungry again and I biked down to Broadway to grab a pizza (a great outing for me). It is weird, but life felt … normal. Our normal, now includes regular check-ins with nurses and doctors who are doing their routines of checking vitals, taking blood, loading Sam’s supplemental feeding, adjusting oxygen… this is normal? this is routine? Yes, it seems to be… and it was all going well until it wasn’t.\nIt is amazing how one tiny little thing can mess up your routine Something jammed up Sam’s NG-tube1.

The medical team is also happy about this latest development.\nActivity levels are also coming up. Sam is able to walk around some more.

We are grateful for all of this. We have been cautioned that these improvements can be expected, but that the only way to evaluate if the cancer is responding is to complete new scans to see what has happened to the tumors.

His body’s immune system was on overdrive in effort to battle what we now know is the cancer. The effect of this was that his whole body inflamed – think of a time that you had a small cut or burn and your skin was red and a little puffy around the injury… now take that idea and apply it to inside Sam’s body, and the majority of the lymphatic system. So why is he so much better now? Why does the treatment seem to be working so well? Is Sam healing?\nTreatment started this past Friday, six days ago, and by the end of Saturday Sam was already feeling much better. This is actually an expected response. I am unclear if how dramatic the response is was expected, but the medical team did expect a fairly rapid response. One of the drugs that is part of Sam chemotherapy prednisone, which can be used to change the way the body ’s immune system reacts – effectively taking the immune system out of overdrive and reducing all that internal swelling.\nSo is Sam getting better? Sam is definitely feeling better and has a much improved quality of life, and I hope and pray that he is getting better in the long term. However, I need to be clear, when it comes to the cancer in his body, we just do not know.\nSam is now scheduled for a scan tomorrow morning. We will know more once those results are in."

The bulk of the day\n\nTo start Sam did go under general anesthetic to adjust his PICC-line and complete a lumbar puncture. The PICC procedure did not go the way the medical team had hoped. The plan was simply to adjust the position of the existing line, but they were not able to do this so they pulled that line and attempted a new line on the other arm. This new line also did not go as planned, as they were not able to centrally locate the outlet. This is where there is some concern, attempts to (re)position the previous or locate the current line failed due to blood clots in Sam’s system. No one is very clear as to why he has clots so frequently in his blood vessels (to be clear this is not because they are keeping anything from us … it is just they do not know). We know that some of the clots are an effect of the cancer – as the body tried to fight it; alternately, this clotting could be somehow related to the previous chemotherapy. The fact is there is clotting in Sam’s blood vessels, and there is more clotting than a couple weeks ago despite taking blood thinners twice a day.\nThe lumbar puncture went as planned.\nThe quiet afternoon turned into an additional procedure. The previous scans had focused on the upper chest and neck. This ultrasound was done to evaluate the potential of clotting in the abdomen and legs. Results are pending.\n\nWe were finally back to the room by about 4pm. Time for dinner. I had left overs. A friend had brought poke bowls yesterday and the left over one as almost as good as the first. Sam had a hospital dinner supplemented with snacks from Safeway. Tina was off on her own adventure.\nI am so happy for Tina as she was able to get away yesterday afternoon. Senga was here and she took her out to a local park and then out for a Tina-friendly meal."

    "text": "Reflections on May 16 and 17\nYesterday morning, as I was considering what to convey, the day started with a challenge… I will get to that, but before I do I actually need to back up two days.\nTwo days ago we had a meeting with our medical team. It was a fairly standard check-in but one that shook Tina and I to the core. We were both, individually, in own personal funks for much of the day before we had an opportunity to discuss it together. During the meeting we were introduced to members of the medical team from Canuck Place. They let us know some of the services that they provide including potential future options respite from the hospital experience. What shook us to the core was the main purpose of Canuck Place – palliative care. To be clear, we are not going down that road, but not knowing what the future holds, it is within the realm of possibility and I suspect that the medical team here had a ethical obligation to ensure this connection was made. We have known this, but the meeting forced us to confront the possibility more directly – again, re-opening this wound/fear.\nTwo days ago was also the fifth of five days of the heavy chemical delivery for this current round of chemotherapy. The remaining 16 days of this chemo round are in place for the chemicals to complete their work, and to allow Sam to recover from it. As of that evening we had not seen much for side effects. Yesterday morning, that would change.\nYesterday, as I was considering what to write, Sam’s day began with a strong wave of nausea and pain. The previous two nights one of the drugs that Sam was given was Cytarabine. I’ll blame that one, though it could been side effects from the whole set. It took several hours to get Sam comfortable, and by the afternoon he was feeling ok, tired but ok. And, though I am exhausted as well, Sam’s fatigue is beyond the lack of sleep we have been having as is a product of the treatment the chemo. In addition the chemotherapy medications will reduce Sam’s blood counts – reducing the capacity of his blood to: provide him energy/oxygen (hemoglobin/ red blood cells), protect him from injury (platelets), and protect him from disease (white blood cells).\nSome positive highlights:\n\nTina and Erin S. were able to spend some time together (2 days ago)\nA relaxed and enjoyable visit with Uncle Cal and cousin Jane (yesterday)\nCoffee and treats sent to by friends."

I expect, that it will be an emotional roller coaster and perhaps this is your experience reading along. This last month has been the most intense of our lives, some days are just plain difficult and painful, others are quiet as we wait for next steps, new phases of experience. In all the days I think I live in a constant state of vigilance, my guard is always up, until something knocks me over. Yesterday, was a quiet day, a day of calm in this storm. My hope is that today will be as well."

We still need to find more rest.\nSide effects: we have have learned some lessons and are managing current side effects well-enough. Other side effects are expected. I expect that Sam’s mouth will be more sensitive as sores develop, these sores could extend all they way through his digestive track. Chemo-balding is also expected.\nPotential for secondary infection: One of the effects of the chemotherapy is a reduction in Sam’s blood counts. The medical team can manage reductions in red cells and platelets, but they cannot manage reduced white cell counts. As such, Sam will be more susceptible to colds, flus, or whatever is floating around. We will likely move to a mask-up and wash-up protocol before entering the room.\nUltimately, that this intense treatment is effective at removing the cancer from Sam’s body."

We were excited to receive update pictures from Joel and Joanna C. as they travelled from Prince George with Sam’s good friends Chase and Ben C. Ben of course brought greetings from his family and Sam and I are now set up with our favourite cookies from Krista. We had an initial visit Saturday evening and despite a having to cancel a morning visit on Sunday the boys had great visits again in the afternoon.\nAn expected side effect from the chemotherapy was a drop in Sam’s blood counts. We saw this over the weekend with a full collapse of Sam’s white count on Sunday. This temporary loss of the body’s ability to fight was also paired with a fever and phlegm. The medical team was ready for this and had Sam on antibiotics right away. Visits were cancelled for most of the day as Tina and I watched our boy sleep most of the day away. By later afternoon, Sam was awake and was welcomed visits from Chase and Ben – though masks were needed for all. So good to see these boy / young men back together again – Good for the soul (ours and Sam’s)!"

In our meeting, she told us about Sam’s latest chest X-ray – the purpose of which was to rule out the potential for pneumonia related to Sam’s cold. There was also enough information in the image that Dr. Cheng could provide a preliminary report: the tumour is smaller than shown in the previous CT scan (taken after round 1 of chemo). We are headed in the right direction – round 1 saw a reduction in the cancerous mass, and round 2 appears to be doing the same! We will know better in with the next scan in a couple weeks when a scan will be done to image the cancer itself.\nAs to what the next steps will be following this round of chemo – that is simply unknown."

The heavy chemical part of the treatment is over and now Sam’s body has to work through the effects. Effects include (these are generally expected):\n\ncollapse of the immune system: Sam’s blood counts are monitored daily. Over the last number of days drops in the red and platelet cells have been managed with transfusions. We need to simply wait for the white cells to come back. It seems Sam may be through the worst of this part as cell counts are beginning to return on their own.\nsores in the GI system. Sam had some sores in his mouth earlier in this process. They have healed but he has other much further on in the system that are painful. These will heal in time.\nMost of Sam’s time is spent in bed … his body is doing a lot of work. The downside of being in bed this long is that he is stiff and sore; he has a lot of muscle tension and very little energy to stretch it out or move to loosen it up. We will get there but there is work to be done.\n\n\nNext steps and current state of the cancer:\n\nThe truth is the next steps are very much unknown. The treatment plan will depend on how the cancer has responded to this latest round of therapy.\nWe are encouraged, Sam had an X-ray to rule out that the flu he had was not causing a pneumonia. This scan confirmed that he did not have pneumonia. What was unexpected, is that the scan also gave us a glimpse at the state of his cancer, and the doctors confirmed that the cancer-mass has shrunk.\nOnce this current therapy is complete on June 2nd Sam will be booked for a scan. Once the results of the scan are known a new plan will be made."

    "text": "Therapy update\nBefore you do just a few quick points to update you on how his journey is going and the next steps as we know them:\n\nWe are currently just past the halfway mark in round 2 of chemotherapy. The heavy chemical part of the treatment is over and now Sam’s body has to work through the effects. Effects include (these are generally expected):\n\ncollapse of the immune system: Sam’s blood counts are monitored daily. Over the last number of days drops in the red and platelet cells have been managed with transfusions. We need to simply wait for the white cells to come back. It seems Sam may be through the worst of this part as cell counts are beginning to return on their own.\nsores in the GI system. Sam had some sores in his mouth earlier in this process. They have healed but he has other much further on in the system that are painful. These will heal in time.\nMost of Sam’s time is spent in bed … his body is doing a lot of work. The downside of being in bed this long is that he is stiff and sore; he has a lot of muscle tension and very little energy to stretch it out or move to loosen it up. We will get there but there is work to be done.\n\n\nNext steps and current state of the cancer:\n\nThe truth is the next steps are very much unknown. The treatment plan will depend on how the cancer has responded to this latest round of therapy.\nWe are encouraged, Sam had an X-ray to rule out that the flu he had was not causing a pneumonia. This scan confirmed that he did not have pneumonia. What was unexpected, is that the scan also gave us a glimpse at the state of his cancer, and the doctors confirmed that the cancer-mass has shrunk.\nOnce this current therapy is complete on June 2nd Sam will be booked for a scan. Once the results of the scan are known a new plan will be made."

    "text": "Meditation Psalm 91\nThank you for journeying with us. May this Psalm inspire your thoughts and prayers:\n\nWhoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High\nwill rest in the shadow of the Almighty.\nI will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,\nmy God, in whom I trust.”\n\nSurely he will save you\nfrom the fowler’s snare\nand from the deadly pestilence.\nHe will cover you with his feathers,\nand under his wings you will find refuge;\nhis faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.\nYou will not fear the terror of night,\nnor the arrow that flies by day,\nnor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,\nnor the plague that destroys at midday.\nA thousand may fall at your side,\nten thousand at your right hand,\nbut it will not come near you.\nYou will only observe with your eyes\nand see the punishment of the wicked.\n\nIf you say, “The Lord is my refuge,”\nand you make the Most High your dwelling,\nno harm will overtake you,\nno disaster will come near your tent.\nFor he will command his angels concerning you\nto guard you in all your ways;\nthey will lift you up in their hands,\nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\nYou will tread on the lion and the cobra;\nyou will trample the great lion and the serpent.\n\n“Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him;\nI will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.\nHe will call on me, and I will answer him;\nI will be with him in trouble,\nI will deliver him and honor him.\nWith long life I will satisfy him\nand show him my salvation.”"

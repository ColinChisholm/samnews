    "text": "Wow! It has been an amazing 48 hours!\nTuesday, two days ago, Santa visited a number of hospitals in the province and our family got to be a part of this celebration. Sam was able to be one of the first to welcome him to the ward and the staff loved his enthusiasm! I am still stunned by the opportunity Tina had to speak with the CBC, with how well she was able to capture what this Christmas means to us, and how it also let the medical team know how important they have been to us.\nYesterday, was a major Christmas present for our family: Sam was discharged from the ward and we are all back at the Ronald McDonald House!\nBefore leaving there was a short ceremony where all of the nurses gathered, a speech was given by one of the doctors to honor Sam for all of the work that he as undertaken – noting especially how he taken such responsibility in understanding the treatments and communicating so well with the team. After, Sam walked out the doors in stark contrast to his arrival by air ambulance eight months ago! He was done and ready to move on – though a part of him will miss the amazing people that have cared for him these last weeks (BMT) and months (Chemotherapy).\nWe will be based at the RMH for the next two months. In this time Sam will be at clinic 2-3 times per week to monitor for potential graft versus host disease (GVHD) which will likely mean lots of minor adjustments to his medications. He has a long list of medications but over time this will be reduced."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less. Tina’s family has been close by and have been able to visit. My parents travelled down and were able to be here, support us, and spend some great time with Sam over several days."

    "text": "The past days\n\n\n\n\nSam and I walking from the RMH to the hospital for a clinic visit. This was the first morning Sam did not need to ride in the chair (Dec. 22nd)!\n\n\n\n\nSam continues to have regular visits at the clinic. Various blood tests are done each time. One specific, the team looks at Tacrolimus levels, an immunosuppressant used to ensure that this BMT is successful and that any graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is minimized. Note: some GVHD is needed so that the new immune system continues to attack any remaining cancer.\nExciting news! The genetic testing of Sam’s immune system confirmed that the donor cells have fully replaced Sam’s native immune system. Ideally, in a BMT transplant the native immune system is removed to make way for the donor cells. There is always a chance that some native cells remain and that a battle for dominance can occur. For Sam, the BMT has gone as planned and all new blood is being generated by the donor cells.\nAll of the blood tests have shown Sam’s counts have come up and are stabilizing.\nI have debated including this next thought … especially during Christmas. It is a challenging reality (skip it if you need to).\n\nSkipRead\n\n\nor click ‘Read’ above\n\n\nChristmas at the Ronald McDonald House is amazing but strange – layered in hope and pain. There is so much generosity poured into this place you cannot help but feel cared for.\n\nDuring these last months, as we have weathered this cancer storm, we have also walked beside a number of other families in similar circumstances. Some are looking forward to completing treatment, while others are in the thick of the storm. Another family, is having an incredibly hard Christmas. They have reached the end of possible treatments and recently moved to hospice to spend what days remain with their child. Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to them.\n\nHere at the Ronald McDonald House joys and pains are especially visible. For me, this raises an inescapable question for life at home. If your Christmas is full of joy, and I truly hope it is, are there pains that may be close but remain unseen? Is there a way to demonstrate love and generosity into those situations?\n\n\n\nSome good normal life has been happening.\n\nSam has had energy to enjoy reading. He finished The Hobbit earlier this week and immediately got into another book.\nNana was able to visit and help us prepare for Christmas.\nWe were able to get off the hospital campus and visit the Frickers – with more family visits planned over the holidays. So great to play family games… this year games also includes some VR which actually has been an amazing physical rehabilitation tool."

    "text": "Looking forward\nIn the weeks ahead we will need to keep a close eye on Sam’s energy levels. We have been given some flexibility in managing steroidal supports (e.g. in response to illness or injury). So if we see his energy fading we can pump him up a little. The steroids are intended to mimic natural bodily levels, as given the previous BMT related treatments his body is not yet generating natural responses – this is all expected (by the doctors). It is also expected that Sam’s own hormone balancing system will restart after a month or two. Again we wait and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope in the waiting\n\n\n\nI can’t help but remember that when we were learning Spanish, in our days working in Guatemala, that verb esperar means to wait, and it also mean to hope (the noun for hope is la esperanza). So when we say we wait – I also mean we hope. Of course, hope itself is a choice. In many ways it is a choice to expect the good and to actively reject living in anxiety. This is more than a psychological trick. Our hope and trust have true foundations. I have hope because of our incredible medical team, and ultimately we have hope in God.\n\n\n\nMedical plans\nThis week will be a return to regular clinic visits. We will also start a repeat of all of the baseline testing that was done prior to the BMT. This will involve visits to all of the specialties in the hospital, and various imaging tests to evaluate if/how this whole BMT journey has impacted Sam.\nWe will also continue weaning the various drugs that Sam has been on – primarily reducing morphine levels."

    "text": "Feb. 9, 2024\n\n\n\nJust a quick update as we continue on this journey.\nThis treatment recovery phase seems long. I shouldn’t be surprised by this, all journeys seems long when you are nearing the end. It is always that last couple hours of a long drive that seem the longest.\nIn this situation, Sam has had some incredible things done to him. The pace of activities and medical interventions has slowed drastically, and Sam’s health is continuing to move in the right direction. His strength and stamina are returning/rebuilding. Sam still struggles with some pain but it has shifted from deep bone pains related to the chemical treatments to muscle pains as he rebuilds his core strength. Everything is moving in the right direction and returning home is getting closer!\nIt has been a good week. Sam has had a distinct return of his appetite and with it he is growing in strength. The discipline of choosing hope, discussed in my last post, has been getting easier given that we are not faced with so many unknowns and anxieties are being replaced with relief.\nOn the medical side, Sam’s medical team is happy to see him regaining capacity. Clinic appointments are becoming less frequent (we are transitioning from 2-3 times per week to just once), and the repeat of the baseline medical testing has been ongoing. Sam should get is central-line removed within the next two weeks.\nNow, our thoughts are turning towards home and what it will mean to return there. Our current expectation is to return near the end of February. Returning will not be as simple as jumping back into life like-it-was. Sam’s immune system, though getting stronger, will still be compromised – the team here suggests that it will take a year before his immune system is back to full-strength. His stamina is building but we will need to guard his capacity. What does this mean practically? I am not sure, but here are a couple guesses: visits will need to be individual or in small groups and we will still need to avoid crowds – at least with Sam. Sam’s diminished strength may mean that visits are short and that he simply powers-out partway through. The return to normal will be in small steps … but we are getting there!\nIt is amazing to think of returning home. Returning to friends and family – we have missed you! It is also amazing to start counting down days! For long time we counted up – not knowing when the end would be. Now the end is in sight! Sam has made it through all of his treatments and it feels like we are on an exit-ramp – we can start preparing for home!"

When you reach out and express your care, your solidarity, and your prayers, you are the hands and feet and face of Christ to us.\nPlease continue to reach out to us – we need you. Please ask your children to reach out to Sam so that he knows he is not alone. Let him know that he is missed and that they are praying/ caring for him despite the physical distance. Many thanks to those who have reached out already and especially to Sam’s friends for reaching out to him.\nThe initial feeling of having our world rocked have shifted.

    "text": "PET scan results\nAlthough busy with regular clinic check-ins, we have had to bide our time since Sam received his bone marrow transplant – 93 days ago. Imaging has had to wait as there was so much going on in Sam’s body it was not possible to get a new image of the state of the cancer. Our assumptions and our hopes were that the prior treatments would have set the cancer back and that the new immune system would then attack anything that remains. However, the PET scan revealed a more complex picture.\n\nOriginal cancerous mass\nImagery of the original mass suggested that the radiation therapy destroyed much of the cancer and likely that there is an on-going war between Sam’s new immune system and the remaining disease. The imagery of this site looks like a solar eclipse – with no activity in the middle, where the radiation focused, but with high activity/avidity around the edges.\n\n\nNew sites\nPerhaps more alarming is that cancer is now active in new areas of Sam’s body. There are three new locations, all of which appear to be within bones (something we have not seen before). Working bottom-up, new sites of cancer are located in Sam’s\n\nleft shin (tibia) slightly below his knee\nhip (right ilium)\nback (T3 vertebrae, between his shoulder blades)\n\nNone of these are currently causing any additional impacts (e.g. bones are still strong, and no nerve impacts). Sam does have some back pain which is likely related to the spot there. These new sites raise questions and there will be a flurry of activity as plans of attack are made."

Next up:\n\nCompleted, Feb 16 morning: CT scan of the T3 vertebrae to assess risk and provide imaging that will assist with treatment planning.\nCompeted, Feb 16: Discussion with with the Orthopedic surgery team to discuss/plan a biopsy of the cancer in Sam’s shin (the easiest of the new sites to access). This was completed by our medical team and it was determined that this biopsy would not be feasible.\nFeb 22: An alternate option is scheduled to biopsy the new cancer in Sam’s back.\nCompleted, Feb 16: Discussion with Radiation Oncologist to discuss new radiation based treatments. Our medical team has been in communication with them and the Radiation team is ready when and if needed.\nOngoing: reduce medications that have kept Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) in-check. Increasing GVHD may help in the battle to kill the cancer … though this will need to be monitored closely to ensure Sam’s good tissues are not damaged.\n\nIt has not even been 48 hours since we received the PET scan results and I hope you can sense that things are moving quickly – action is being taken.\nAlthough there is a lot going on we were also able to get out and enjoy life."

    "section": "This past week’s medical journey",
    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nIt has been a whirlwind of a week filled with anxious waiting, clinic visits most days, pain management, prayers, and the love of family.\nIt was one week ago today that Sam had a biopsy of one of the new disease sites. That procedure went exactly as planned and the tissue was sent to the BC Cancer lab for analysis – though we would not hear about the results until after the weekend.\nFriday we were in clinic for a regular blood levels check and a quick exam. At the time, I was asked if Sam’s symptoms had changed and all I could say was ‘No, he seems to be doing well’. However, that would change over the following days as new pains mounted. I think of these as pain-spikes as they would come on quickly and cause changes in his pain management regime (i.e. drug doses were increased). We are thankful that we have such access to medical advice – though Sam and Tina deserve direct credit for sorting out the latest pain-spike.\n\nThe Finding and The Plan\n\nDuring Tuesday’s visit Dr. Jacob let us all know about the results of the biopsy. The new disease sites are the same cancer (primarily characterized by its INI1 protein deletion). This information was critical to know in order to determine what treatments would be available for Sam. To be honest, the medical toolkit is getting low in options, but at least we still do have options:\n\nFurther chemotherapy is not an option. This cancer has become resistant and that line of therapy would put Sam’s new immune system at risk.\n\nRadiation can be applied but is not a long term solution. We will use it to reduce the burden-of-disease on Sam. In particular it will be used on his T3-vertebrae to prevent potential growth at that site from impinging on Sam’s nerves.\nA drug therapy for Sam has been approved. Nivolumab is used for immunotherapy, though special approval was needed to use it on a BMT recipient. In general terms, this drug will take-the-brakes off Sam’s immune system. Specifically, and as I understand it, this drug disables proteins on the cancer cells that allow them to remain invisible to the immune system. This is a very similar philosophy of treatment as the BMT – to enable the immune system, and in Sam’s case to support his new immune system, to identify and destroy the cancer.\nThe challenge is, until recently we have done the opposite, keeping the immune system brakes on so that the new immune system will not harm Sam’s healthy tissues. The medical team will be watching him closely. The goal: release the immune system to attack while watching for signs that the immune system does not harm Sam – it will be a fine balance.\n\nThere are risks but we are excited to move forward with this option/opportunity to destroy this disease. Sam is excited and these options and expected hospital times, depending on how he tolerates the treatment, could be less difficult than he had imagined.\nToday Sam will start this new immunotherapy treatment. He will be in-hospital for several days to ensure there are no complications. Assuming there are none we will be back at the RMH early next week.\nTomorrow Sam will also make a trip to the BC Cancer Clinic at VGH to have a CT scan which will provide the radiation oncology team the data that they need to complete the planning of their treatments."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nJust over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on Nivolumab with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer. We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

Sam will receive a dose of radiation to each site every day for two weeks (10 business days). Assuming all goes well this will simply mean a short drive to BC Cancer clinic for the treatment and then a return to RMH.\n\nResults and effectiveness\n\nWe are not going to know how any of these treatments are working for some time. It is too soon to tell if the immune therapy is working. Following radiation, we will need to wait a couple weeks for that treatment to take effect. … So we wait.\n\n\nFor now the best indicator of how things are going is with Sam. How he is feeling. Where is pain levels are. How his body reacts to the treatments."

Sam reminded me that we have been here five months longer than expected. He is right. The initial plan if everything had gone as expected/hoped would have seen us go home this past October. Next, the BMT process, should have seen us go home last week. Now, when are we going to get home? Simply, we just do not know.\nIn the meantime, we are enjoying life together. It is a simple life that includes medical care, meals, and time together. When Sam has the energy we get out of the building. Lately, he has enjoyed a trip to a local bookstore. In our room, Tina and I are thrilled when Sam has the energy to connect with friends and play some online games (which he has been able to do a couple times this week). Programs here at the Ronald McDonald House have been helpful. Sam has taken to playing the drums – I don’t know where he gets his rhythm from but he is a natural. I have enjoyed playing and learning a few new things on guitar. Tina has made it to a couple painting classes. We have also been able to connect with a number of other families including playing some board games together.\nWe are encouraged by visitors, Grace and Darren from Prince George, Tina’s Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth originally from England but now in Abbotsford, and Tina’s family: siblings, Nana Mary, and Sam’s cousins are all in the Lower Mainland and we see some of them weekly.\nOne highlight from this past week was that we have moved to a larger room. This will allow us to enjoy our space more including providing some space for some anticipated guests."

My favourite quotes come from him on a near daily basis: “I have an amazing life” or “I am so happy”. His challenges are beyond my wildest nightmares but he remains strong, and full of hope. He is surrounded by the love of his family. He knows you are out there supporting him and we regularly share notes of encouragements as a family.\nThis past week we have received incredible support, following the news of more cancer when we had thought there would be less. Tina’s family has been close by and have been able to visit. My parents travelled down and were able to be here, support us, and spend some great time with Sam over several days."

However, in doing so we recognize that this may also cause side effects that we have been hoping to avoid. He will remain in hospital for monitoring overnight and if he remains stable he may be discharged to the RMH over the weekend.\nNext week Sam will have another contrast-CT in an attempt to image if any impacts can be measured.\nSo how are we doing through all of this you ask? It would be a lie to say we are not scared. The disease has been a constant threat and now more than ever. However, there are great moments of joy. It is impossible not to smile when Sam wakes from a nap with a big smile on his face saying “I’m so happy.” He is happy – he knows he is cared for and he knows that he is loved.",

    "text": "Recap of the last week\n\nCancer war\nIt has been over a week since I last wrote and we have been continuing along two lines of attack against the cancer in Sam’s body.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nEach weekday we have made a trip down to the BC Cancer Centre, about a 10 minute drive away. Sam is/has undergone targeted radiation for the three new disease sites discovered last month. These visits are fairly quick with about 15 minutes needed per site and most of that time is simply setting up/positioning Sam to target the sites the same way each time. Last week treatment of the sites below his knee and on his hip were completed – as these were not near critical organs they received higher doses of radiation per treatment. Treatment of the disease on Sam’s back will be completed at the end of this week. Evaluation of how well the treatments worked will not be for a minimum of 2-3 weeks.\n\nImmune therapy\n\nLast Thursday, Sam was due to have another dose of Nivolumab two weeks following his initial dose. However, this second dose was delayed as his bloodwork suggested that his liver was inflamed and as such it could be dangerous to give another dose. It was a good decision! Over this past weekend Sam has much stronger symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) than we have seen the entire time since receiving his bone marrow transplant (BMT).\n\n\nAs a reminder, the intent of the BMT was to give Sam a new immune system that would recognize the cancer and destroy it. The weeks following the transplant Sam was on a medication to keep the new immune system in-check and reduce symptoms of GVHD. Now that we know that there is more cancer, steps are being taken to release the new immune system to be more aggressive. Essentially, using different drugs, we went from applying the brakes to the immune system to adding fuel to it. The goal: activate/jump-start the immune system to attack the cancer. Of course doing this has the potential to unleash the immune system to also attack Sam’s healthy tissues.\n\n\nThis past weekend Sam had intense rashes and evidence that the GVHD was not only active on the outside of his body but also the inside (e.g. loss of taste, increased liver enzymes). The GVHD seemed to reach a peak on the weekend. Recent bloodwork seems to align with the symptoms we have been observing. If Sam’s immune system continues to settle back down we will likely continue with this line of treatment.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral living\nSam’s life is pretty simple: watching too much YouTube, and when he has more energy, he reads, plays video games (only rarely able to sit up to play on his PC), and occasionally reviews some studies. Lately, his activity has been limited to short walks, mostly around the RMH. He also enjoys visiting with people, though his capacity can often be low causing visits to be short (e.g. 30 minutes). Despite the length of this journey and current challenges Sam still maintains a positive attitude with statements like: “I love my life.”, “I am so happy”, “We have a great family”.\nOur parental pride swelled earlier this week. A boy here at the RMH, I’ll call him B., is about five years old and has looked up to Sam. B. was having a hard week and mad at the world – Sam decided to brighten his day. Sam chose a lego set which I purchased when I was out. Sam was able to give it to him the next day and also spent some time helping him assemble it. B. was thrilled! So great that Sam took the opportunity to care for this young man!\nWe continue to enjoy visits with family. Tina’s family members, who live in the region, try to make a point of being here each week. We look forward to seeing them on their usual days.\nWe also love to see friends as they are able to come through. This past week it was great to see Jess and John with Kate and John (Jr.)."

Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the three of us plus Chase there.\nThis past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with a party atmosphere at the arena!"

Preliminary results may be available in clinic that afternoon though the full report may have to wait until Friday. Results of this scan will dictate next steps. If the results are positive then we can proceed with our preferred treatment option: to simply keep doing what we have been doing over the last number of weeks – let the immune system do its work and wait-and-see. If results are more challenging we will discuss options with the team here at BC Children’s."

    "section": "Cancer war",
    "text": "Cancer war\nSam has summarized this the past two PET scans in the following way (parap hrased):\n\nThe PET scan in February was like someone dumped a load of bricks on me.\nThis last PET scan was like someone removed all the bricks but then threw a single one at me.\n\nSam is great spirits. As the impacts of radiation therapy are behind him, and the effects of GVHD1 are lessening he is seeing his energy return. Today he wants to go grocery shopping with me.\n\nReview\nThe previous PET, back on Feb 14, provided really hard news. Following months of seeing a new immune system be established in Sam (Nov. - Feb) that imaging showed three new disease sites – it seemed that all of the previous efforts were for naught and that we were losing the cancer war. Despite all of the efforts of the BMT to establishing a new immune system, it did not seem to be effective at beating back the cancer.\nSince the discovery of the new sites Sam has received immunotherapy (via the drug Nivomulab) as well as targeted radiation treatment to the new disease centers. The radiation therapy was straight forward and ended a couple weeks ago. With the immune therapy Sam was only able to have a single dose of the Nivomulab which triggered more GVHD2 than he had seen during his BMT3. Although this GVHD was not physically comfortable (e.g. hot rashes, GI4 effects) it was mentally comforting – if the immune system was attacking healthy tissue it meant that it was most likely also attacking the cancer. Most recently, the immune system started getting dangerously out of control by stressing Sam’s liver. In response, he was started on some steroids to put the brakes on his immune system and bring it back in-check.\nThis sets the stage for the PET scan this past Friday (April 5).\n\n\nPET scan results\nApril 5th scan\n\nRadiated sites\nWe have clear wins! No cancer was detectable in the three sites discovered back in Feb. The cancer in his T3 vertebrae, hip, and shin has been wiped out by the radiation therapy.\n\n\nCentral mass\nThe mass in the center of Sam’s chest, the one that brought us down here to start with, is stable. There is increased metabolic activity in the area but it remains the same size as previous – and potentially a little smaller. What is exciting about this is that the only thing keeping this site in-check would have been Sam’s immune system. The fact that this site is stable suggests that the immune system is able to battle whatever cancer is still in this area.\n\n\nChallenges\nA single new site has been located. The new site is located in Sam’s liver. For now we have to assume that this is new disease site (i.e. the same type of cancer in a new location). However, it is possible that is something else. The liver is a big organ, one that is hard to do surgery on, but this new site is superficial (near the surface) just below Sam’s lower rib on the right side. Given where this site is we are hoping that a biopsy can be completed this coming week."

Nana Mary, Uncles Kevin and Cal were also able to come in the afternoon that we received the PET scan results.\nYesterday, Tina and I were able to visit with Brian, Beth, David, and Luke. A definitely highlight from that visit was seeing Sam have energy to talk with his friend!\n\n\nTragedy\nYesterday’s visits were filled with joy. But the day was also filled with sorrow.

After a couple of days our own home was ready to return to.\nDuring this break it was most encouraging for me to simply watch our boy! He loved being home and jumped full into life there:\n\nSam loved connecting with friends.\nHe chose to jump right back into school despite having missed the last third of grade 9 and almost all of grade 10. Many thanks to the staff and students at Cedars who welcomed Sam back in and allowed him to engage with his academics.\nHe pushed hard to catch up on a couple topics often spending 2-3 hours a day on homework. … Honestly he had seemed to have more energy than I did.\nThis last Friday, after writing a three hour math test during the day, Sam even attended the school dance.

Sam has had such great energy lately. He has been waking up at the same time as me and we have spent our days together – talking, playing, reading, and even sharing the chores.\nIn the early morning just over a year ago, on April 18, 2023, Sam arrived at BC Children’s hospital. Oh, how far he as come along this incredible journey of seeing him return to health. He is by no means out-of-the-woods yet, but now he can “walk-in-the-woods” with us. Sam is joyful, he has increasing energy and stamina, and his courageous attitude seems to have no limits.\nOne year ago Tina and Sam had been sent down by air ambulance and were admitted directly to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). I arrived about twelve hours later. Sam remained in PICU for the next number of days while the medical team stabilized him, and initial imaging and biopsies were completed. It would be 10 days later that the biopsy reports were completed and Sam’s cancer was identified. Once identified, we knew we would be travelling a challenging road – one that was not mapped by any procedures or protocols that the medical team could follow."

    "text": "Major Milestones\nWhat a journey this has been. Sam has been through three eras of cancer treatment: 1) chemotherapy, 2) BMT, and now 3) immune therapy. Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy. Below is provided a quick review of the major milestones.\n\nChemotherapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\nApril 17\nAn alarming x-ray in Prince George provided evidence that Sam needed urgent care at BCCH.\n\n\nApril 18\nAir Ambulance in the early morning and admission to BCCH’s PICU.\n\n\nApril 22\nTransfer to BCCH Oncology Ward (T8).\n\n\nApril 28\nDiagnosis of a extremely rare form of lymphoma.\n\n\nApril 29\nChemotherapy is initiated. Sam will receive an additional 6 full rounds of chemotherapy taking him into October.\n\n\nJune 2\nFollowing his second round of chemotherapy Sam was discharged from the hospital for the first time. This marks the beginning of our family life at RMH. The next months we would visit the oncology clinic regularly. When it was time for each round of chemotherapy we would check into the ward for about 5 days.\n\n\nJuly 14\nPlans for a bone marrow transplant were initiated. By mid-summer it became apparent that the chemotherapy would not remove all of the cancer. The remaining rounds of chemotherapy would reduce the cancer as much as possible, and keep it from spreading to new locations, while the BMT was being organized.\n\n\nSept. 26\nPreparations for BMT, baseline testing of Sam was initiated to evaluate impacts of the BMT (i.e. eye, ear, skin, and lung capacity testing).\n\n\nOct. 15\nSam completed his final round of chemotherapy.\n\n\nOct. 23\nTargeted radiation therapy over three days to destroy the central mass in Sam’s chest is initiated.

Results were not available until August 6.\nPET results indicated significant growth of the cancerous mass. This irregular heterogenus mass has an average cross section of ~7.5cm. A further contrast CT was completed on August 6th to evaluate how the mass was impacting the heart and general bloodflow. The disease has now resulted in blockage of both the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Sam has an extensive network of collateral veins (smaller vessels that allow blood return from his head to bypass these blockages). Additional concern has been raised that disease impacts are beginning to restrict flow in the superior vena cava.",

    "text": "Travel log\nThe initial idea to travel was presented last Wednesday, April 17. However, actual travel plans were dependent on metrics on Sam’s bloodwork that would allow the medical team to decide if it would be safe for Sam to travel. Specifically, if Sam’s numbers were not good on the Friday, we check again on the Monday, and if they were not good then the trip would be cancelled. So to keep things flexible we chose to drive. As a family we have always done road trips and Sam was looking forward to this pilgrimage drive home.\n\nDay 1 – Travel\nSunday, April 21\nWe got away from Vancouver at a good time. It was a cool cloudy day with some showers heading into the Fraser Canyon. We had a great early lunch at Horsting’s Farm near Cache Creek. In the afternoon we stopped to see Renee near Williams Lake. Refreshed and fed we travelled on arriving at my parents as the sun was setting.\nWe received a loving welcome from Mom and Dad and all of us loved seeing Sam reconnect with Buddy – his dog was crazy excited to see him! We were also able to catch the last two periods of the first Vancouver vs. Nashville playoff game.\n\n\nDay 2 – Family\nMonday\nThis was really the only day that we had any sort of plan which was to make family our priority. The earlier part of the day was spent with my parents and the evening with Tom, Margaret, Daniel and Alex. Good times connecting, talking, and playing games together.\n\n\nDay 3 – School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam loved reconnecting with his friends at school and later at youth group!\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nWe let this day be driven by Sam and how he was feeling – he was feeling good. Mid-morning Sam had a great idea of visiting his friends at school over the lunch break. It was so good to see him simply slip into life at the school. We ended up spending the entire afternoon there as Sam joined in to classes. Tina and I connected with staff and a number of friends as parents rolled in for afterschool pickup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4 – Whirlwind\nWednesday\nWednesday was more of a whirlwind. Sam had an appointment at the hospital pediatric clinic. This was our first connection with the Prince George team. Although they do not specialize in cancer treatment it was good to see how much ca be taken care of at the hospital back home. In the afternoon we squeezed in some visits with friends and dinner with the grandparents. In the evening Sam was able to attend youth group at the church!\n\n\n\n\nDay 5 – Return to Vancouver\nThursday\nWe had to head back to Vancouver. It was a great road trip. Sam is looking forward to the day when he can be the driver. In the meantime he watched the road and acted as a good copilot.\nIt was a great first trip home and hopefully our next one will be in the near future and with more days at home."

    "text": "It has been ten days since we returned to Vancouver. Life has been fairly routine, even slow. We have we been checking in with the hospital clinic and so far the metrics associated with Sam’s liver numbers are going the right direction. This suggests that the liver is healing/ becoming less inflamed.\nThis week we have a few items on the agenda: a) Clinic check-ins; b) Ultrasound of the liver to verify that the non-cancerous mass there is either stable or improving; and c) PET scan (possibly). The PET scan is the big item as it will show us the status of the cancer in Sam’s body. Results of the PET will also strongly inform Sam’s next treatment(s).\nThis journey has been long and we are tired. This past weekend family facilitated giving me a break. Tina and Sam stayed with Mary and the Fricker family (Tina’s sister’s family) giving me almost 24 hours off. It was great to have that time without responsibilities.\nSam remains positive and continues to get stronger. Tina and I are glad to see this. However, we cannot escape feelings of needing-to-be-vigilant and anxiousness about what could be happening undetected – the results of the PET scan this week will be very helpful."

Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at minimum the day leading up to them are intense. It is weird because the scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is happening. They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that we fear. To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for. This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.\nThe results of this last scan, like many others, has mixed news.\n\nCancer status\nThe good news is that since Feb 5th there are no new disease sites.\nThe difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam’s chest remains and has grown a small amount. The previous scan, April 5, showed no detectable change at that site and so to have this new growth strongly suggests that the cancer is active there. Options for treatment are limited and it is unknown if they will be effective.\n\n\nLiver status\nThe previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active site in Sam’s liver could be cancer. This has been ruled out via biopsy. We have known for sometime that Sam’s liver has been stressed due to side-effects of his immune therapy treatment causing his immune system to become deregulated. Latest metrics of Sam’s liver health have been improving. Recent ultrasound of the liver shows a minor increase in size. The Doctors want to continue monitoring this mass as it is not an urgent priority right now."

If we go this route, the team would use the lessons learned from last time to modify their therapy plan in an attempt to limit side-effects.\n\nIf side-effects can be avoided, this will likely be the more effective treatment.\nIf side-effects cannot be avoided, this treatment could cause permanent harm (eg. the risk of liver failure)."

The cancer aside, Sam is healthy, regaining weight, growing, and getting stronger.\nIn the last couple of weeks we have been instituting Sam’s foodie-rehab plan. This is where we walk from RMH to the small mall at Oak and King Edward. Once there, Sam has been enjoying most items at Kim’s Express (Vietnamese food). One evening Sam led our family for a larger walk, one that I did not know he was capable of, down to Cambie Village about 1.5kms away. We had some great ice cream before walking back. This was an epic evening for our family.\nOver this past weekend we were able to join some of the Frickers and the Townsend side of the family to experience the animals at Aldor Farms near Ft. Langley. I loved watching Sam take some time to groom Rob, a huge Percheron work horse.\nYesterday, we celebrated Mothers Day. Ronald McDonald House put on a beautiful brunch. In the evening, we took in the Canucks vs. Oilers hockey game (which Sam mostly slept through due to being tired from his big farm day Saturday)."

The initial attempt to use Nivolumab, at the end of Feb., did not go well and resulted in lost time recovering from side effects (primarily liver inflammation). Currently, the combination of these two drugs seems to be working well – specifically, metrics related to Sam’s liver are stable and even in normal ranges.\nSam also had an MRI of his chest last week the results of which were encouraging. Though it is too soon to tell, or to relate the scan to the latest drug regime, the results indicated that the cancerous mass had not grown (in contrast to the previous PET scan). We are once again hopeful that the cancer can be held back/ controlled. The MRI also provided incredible details of Sam’s upper body and the medical team will continue to review this latest set of images to evaluate future treatment options."

Steps are being taken to manage what all indications suggest is lymphoma. Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

Since receiving his BMT1 Sam has had some level of GVHD2. One ongoing effect of GVHD is that fluid has built up around his heart (measured using an echocardiogram). To date this has not impacted his heart function. The challenge and safety concern is that the new immunotherapy treatment will likely intensify GVHD impacts that could put his heart at risk.\nSo instead of treating the cancer, last week Sam was started on a steroid to reduce GVHD effects.

We will spend several days there as he is scheduled for a PET scan, an ultrasound, and another dose of Nivolumab.\nIn the meantime we have just over a week at home. We are loving it here – however in some ways it is a strange adjustment (including not having Tina’s parents here). Many thanks to whoever mowed our backyard! In this time we will celebrate birthdays, I will get to work for some part days, and we hope to continue reconnecting with our Prince George friends and family."

I would be lying if I said that all of us are feeling great this morning. The reality is that scan days are always stressful as they mark significant chapters in Sam’s treatment. They mark significant pivot points where treatment plans are adjusted – either to keep going with the treatment regime or change it up. Perhaps today’s scan is all the more stressful as it is to determine if one of our last treatment options (immunotherapy combined with a new medication) is working or not. Additionally, being back in Vancouver and being under the watchful eye of our medical team is in stark contrast to the freedom, fun-living, and joy had with friends this past week."

Most of this day and all of the days prior that week Sam had been feeling the effects of his immunotherapy drugs – generally wiped-out/lethargic and achy.\nIn the evening he had a return of energy and the Bandstra, Claus, and Cross families rearranged their plans and came over. We had a great summer evening in the back yard talking and playing games. Sam was especially encouraged receiving the care of friends.\n\nSunday\n\nTina and I made it to church… well we made it in the door and then spent the time connecting with people. Sam slept in that morning but gave me a call asking to come greet people following the service. It was encouraging for all!\n\n\nIn the evening, Sam having heard from his friends the night before about how great working at Ness Lake Bible Camp was, he asked to go and visit – which we did. However, Sam wasn’t satisfied with visiting and by the end of the evening he had spent several hours working in the kitchen or wherever else he was able.\n\n\nMonday\n\nWe figured that Sam would need a rest day – we were wrong! That afternoon Tina took Sam out to camp again where he worked, visited, and took part in cabin time with the kids!\n\n\nThat evening some of the church leaders came by to support and pray with us and for Sam – more encouragement.\n\nTuesday\n\nI spent the morning at work – made it out to the forest. It was great to be there again. Also, to connect with my work-world people!\n\n\nSam was not going to miss out, and he was out to serve at camp again. Tina had expected to take him home at any point, but he stayed until late in the evening! He even had energy for the evening Safari game where leaders dress up as animals and the campers have to hunt them. He had an amazing time. Though a fall during the game resulted in us putting him in an air-cast. An x-ray, if needed, will be completed while we are here in Vancouver. This leg pain was all worth the experience of joining the team.\n\nWednesday\n\nAs a family, we focused on packing up to be ready to head south.\n\n\nSam was thinking he would have a rest day but having received an invite from camp to join in on activities, he was not going to miss out. That evening Sam, although hobbling with the air-cast, took part in work projects, discussion times, and then the end-of-week button ceremony where Sam was awarded two buttons. The encouragement definitely went both ways: camp leaders were so impressed with Sam, while Sam had his heart-bucket filled to overflowing.\n\nFrom Dave Horton’s post:\n\nSam Chisolm earned his summer team shirt and both director pins (which does not happen ever)…\n\nfor serving others (through some physical pain) before himself\nfor going from a visitor to “what can I do to help.”\n\nDude helped with dishes, A team, camper supervision and more. We could not find enough for him to do.\n\n\n\nTina, Sam, and I have been so encouraged by these days that Sam had in camp. It was amazing to see him rise and have the energy to engage. Amazing to see the joy he had. A huge thank you to all of the Ness Lake Crew – thank you for welcoming Sam onto the team!\n\nThursday\n\nWe got away from Prince George in great time. Had a great visit with family in Langley and then settled into the RMH that evening."

The left and right brachiocephalic veins are blocked by impacts of the disease (the main veins transporting blood from Sam’s head to his heart).

He will remain in hospital for monitoring overnight and if he remains stable he may be discharged to the RMH over the weekend.\nNext week Sam will have another contrast-CT in an attempt to image if any impacts can be measured.\nSo how are we doing through all of this you ask? It would be a lie to say we are not scared. The disease has been a constant threat and now more than ever. However, there are great moments of joy. It is impossible not to smile when Sam wakes from a nap with a big smile on his face saying “I’m so happy.” He is happy – he knows he is cared for and he knows that he is loved."

We need something that will work. We need a miracle.\nIt was amazing to see Sam join the Ness Lake Bible Camp team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.\nWe are thankful to the medical team here at BC Childrens’ Hospital who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.\nWe are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nThankful for such supportive family caring for us in all through this journey.\nWe long for the day when Sam is free of this disease."

    "text": "Transplant ongoing\n\n\n\nSam started receiving the donated bone-marrow/ stem cells at 5:06pm. It is 6:50pm as I write this. Everything is going well as Sam has not had any reactions to these currently foreign cells – cells that will become his own. He should have all finish reciving the material in the next twenty minutes. Sam is sleeping through it all.\nToday is the day and Sam is ready!\nSam had a couple rough days leading up to today but he is now comfortable, settled into the the isolation room, and ready to take on the BMT. The actual transplant will happen later today and should be rather anti-climatic. The transplant is similar to receiving blood the difference being that the material in the bag will be bone marrow stem cells. These cells will take up residence in Sam’s bone marrow and start generating new blood – transplanted blood providing a new immune system.\nYesterday went well. The greatest challenge was moving Sam across the hall. It sounds simple but I was wiped out by the end of the day. In moving over everything had to be sterilized. Most items were thoroughly wiped, and placed in clean containers. Laundry had to be re-done as I had not washed the clothes to BMT clean standards. The medical team also had a big task taking all of the furniture out of the room, sterilized the room, and then they cleaned and sterilized each piece of furniture before returning it.\nSam’s isolation room is similar to the other rooms here on the ward. It has his medical bed, a recliner chair and a fold down couch/bed for Tina and I. The difference is that there is a small anteroom. This room has two sets of glass sliding doors. One door leads to the ward and the other to Sam’s room. Only one door is allowed to be open at one time to ensure that the air in Sam’s room is clean. In the anteroom we clean any items before they are passed into the room. It also in this room that we put on gowns to cover out ‘dirty’ outside world clothing. It is actually much simpler for Tina and I to leave and enter than I had expected.\nYesterday’s highlights was seeing friends. Sam was able to visit with Ben while Tina and I visited with David and Krista C. – following their visit Sam moved to the isolation room. In the evening Uncle Cal stopped was able to wave at Sam through the window. Senga and Tina were also able visit."

    "text": "The Chisholm family at the Ronald McDonald House. Fall 20231.\nSam is a courageous champion! He has now endured and completed two types of cancer treatment, and is ready to take-on the upcoming bone marrow transplant (BMT). Over the past six months Sam’s treatments have focused on attacking the cancer cells within his body. He received six rounds of chemical chemotherapy between May and Oct. Over the last two weeks, following the completion of the initial chemotherapy treatment, tactics were changed to use radiation therapy against the largest detectable cancerous mass that remains in the center of his chest. The upcoming BMT will mark a significant change in strategy for removing the cancer. Instead of attacking the cancer directly the BMT will provide a long-term indirect assault on the cancer (long-term being life-long). This process will replace Sam’s immune system – removing his current native immune defenses and replacing them with a donated immune system. Where Sam’s immune system was not effective at detecting and attacking the cancer it is expected that the new immune system will. This process is not easy and Sam may face his greatest challenges to date. However, he is looking forward to completing these next phases.\nThere are currently 8 days until Sam receives the actual transplant. However, there are numerous steps/procedures to be completed to prepare his body for this process. This Wednesday he starts these steps."

Monday through Friday this past week marked Sam’s second and final week of targeted radiation therapy to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. The actual procedure was usually not more than 15 minutes but it would dominate out entire day. Each day we would get ready, load up and head down to the BC Cancer clinic, a short drive away. Tina and Sam would check in while I attempted to find parking – there were a few days where Sam was done before I was able to park the van. Following treatment we would return to the RMH. Sam has generally felt well though with increasing fatigue. His medical team is happy with his current health: He is an otherwise healthy young man, but with cancer.\nWe may never know the full impact that the radiation will have on the cancer. The radiation therapy can take weeks to show measurable impacts but by that point we will be well into the BMT process. I expect next scans to evaluate the various treatments and the state of the cancer will not be feasible until into the new year.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe were able to visit with and be encouraged by some family and friends this past week. Aunt Tricia put on an amazing meal. Uncle Cal paid a visit. Sam was able to have some time hanging out with cousin Kaden, while Tina and I visited with Kevin, Shannon, and Nana. Yesterday John, Jess, Kate, and John Jr. stopped by for a few hours. Tina was able to have and afternoon away visiting with her cousins in Abbotsford."

    "section": "Not an ideal plan",
    "text": "Not an ideal plan\nWe are moving forward with a bone-marrow-transplant (BMT), but we are not in an ideal situation. Ideally, and for best results, when moving to BMT the medical team would like the cancer to be non-detectable. With Sam, starting from where he was back in April, the cancerous mass has been reduced in size, but a significant mass remains. It is not operable as it is in the lymphatic system; although it can be located, as I understand it, it is too amorphous and intertwined within his healthy tissues and bear vital organs (e.g. heart and lungs).\n\nChallenges ahead\nIn the weeks ahead Sam will be facing a number of challenges (see The Plan).\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

In-hospital is not where we had hoped to be this Thanks Giving, as family in the area were hoping to host us. It would have been great to share a meal, visit with them, and catch up the additional nephews that had flown in. Despite our current situation we still have so much to be thankful for. Top of my mind:\n\nWe are here and we have access to an incredible medical team and facility.\nWe are able to walk this journey as a family. Support from work, family and friends, church, and the local community allows us to be here without having to worry about life and responsibilities back home. Thank you!\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides us a home away from home.\nSam has been able to connect with friends – especially in the last couple weeks. They talked or talked while playing online games.\nVisitors: We have family in the area that come by on a regular basis to support us. We have friends that make extra efforts to some and see us.\n\n\nHighlights from this past week\n\nBaseline tests and clinic days\n\nAs we begin to wrap up round 6 and pivot to bone-marrow transplant there are many medical appointments. This week was full with regular clinic visits plus the addition of baseline tests.\n\nThursday Nana and Kevin visit\n\nKevin and I got away – we roamed around downtown and grabbed dinner. It was great to away from the hospital campus for a few hours.\n\n\nNana visited with Sam and Tina at the Ronald McDonald House. Following the loss of Gord, Mary has moved south where she is surrounded by family and can access Sam. She in a suite attached to Kevin and Shannon’s.\n\nFriday’s fever\n\nIt was a normal clinic visit on Friday morning. We had gone in expecting to review blood levels and then return to the RMH. However, Sam spiked a fever. In a normal non-cancer scenario any of us would just sleep it off, but Sam’s immune system is compromised. Antibiotics were started, tests and bacterial cultures were ordered, and plans were made to admit Sam to the ward for this past weekend. We are hoping/expecting to be discharged later today to return to the RMH.\n\n\nDave and Louise SP, friends of ours working in SE Asia were able to stop by before catching their flight back. Great to catch up with and be encouraged by them.\n\nSupercars Saturday\n\nOne of the other parents at the RMH was able to connect with a group of Supercar owners. We thought we might miss-out but the doctor here gave Sam an afternoon pass to take part. We were able to talk with the owners, look at, sit in, and got for some quick rides in these beautiful cars. Makes included Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and Mercedes. I think whenever I see one of these cars on the road I will always remember the joy on all the families faces and the hospitality of all the owners."

With the completion of this last/ sixth round of chemotherapy we will pivot to the bone marrow treatment plan.\nThat we would have enough strength/stamina, especially for Sam, as we are booked solid preparing for the BMT.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:\n\nWe are thankful for a donor who is a match for Sam and that they are willing to undergo the full bone marrow extraction process!\nWe are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects long term.\nThe medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. All the pieces need to fall into place for the best timing possible.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

Sam only needed one transfusion this round (platelets). Friday, Sam was scheduled to have a PET. This scan generates a 3-dimensional image of his body and where the cancer is in it. However, maintenance issues caused this scan to be postponed – hopefully Sam can get in this Wednesday.\nThe rest of the week was focused on the management of Sam’s side-effects. We have had to be very strict with the scheduling his medications this round. We have seen decent success in managing his nausea and some success in managing his pain. Sam’s energy levels have been low, and his bone ache as his marrow is in full production mode to restore the blood that was destroyed in this last round of chemo."

Thursday afternoon we were in to check levels to prepare for Friday’s LP1. Friday was a long day in the clinic: Platelets first, then the LP, and Hemoglobin provided in the afternoon.\nWith the completion of clinic procedures and a couple units of new blood Sam was ready to go. We packed up and made our way to Ft. Langley for a great reunion! Sam has been having great visits with my parents and Buddy these last couple days.

Despite this, I received it like a gut-punch.\nWhat it came down to is making a contingency plan. Sam’s cancer is unknown and as such it is impossible to know if the current treatment will be fully effective. If it is not, then what next? We discussed the possibility of following the current treatment up with a bone marrow transplant. There is quite a lot of planning needed to move forward with a such a procedure as a donor needs to be found. So we are starting now.\nThe bone marrow transplant treatment, if needed, would start following the current treatment (~early Oct), and would add some significant time to our stay down here.\nIf it is needed, of course we will do it. We just hope that it is not needed."

The remainder of our days have at RMH and for the most part in our room here. Sam is mid-way through this cycle of chemotherapy and as expected his blood counts are falling. This means that his energy levels are low, and that his immune system is compromised. The best thing we can do is keep him from getting sick – hide away until his system starts recovering.\n\nHospital ER visit\nLast night we paid a visit to the ER. Sam was having chest pain and headaches that would come in waves. The medical team pursued the potential for a blood embolus (throwing a clot) ordering ECGs, bloodwork, and a CT. After a few hours these pains subsided, and the tests were all clear. So a bit of a mystery but good that there was nothing serious."

This morning marks day 19 of this round of chemotherapy – Sam has made it through the chemo-valley without the need of hospital time (his numbers are starting to recover). What a difference!\nIt is really weird as it seems we stumbled our way into this out-patient status. With the exception of four nights, when Sam received the chemo-chemicals, he has been out of the hospital for this round. Sam has had clinic appointments twice a week, and at each one we half-expected that he may need to be admitted. We know now that, even with dropping blood levels, if Sam keeps feeling good there was no need to return to the hospital. Living on the hospital campus makes out-patient life feasible as in the event Sam got sick (e.g. due to his chemo-compromised immune) we would simply visit the ER here and follow the oncology patient protocols."

The lab is fast – blood levels were back levels are dropping, but again they are still above any levels of concern.\n\n\nI clarified with the doctor, wondering if it was possible to skip the valley caused by chemotherapy. As I understand it:\n\nThe valley will come. Sam’s immune system will collapse to zero (as indicated by the ANC1 metric). … Yes, I have created a graph for this.\nBe flexible, each round of chemo is different. Some rounds the valley is short. Some the valley is long. Be flexible, as it is not possible to know.\n\nIn the afternoon, we had a great visits Chris and Jane, and David C. We all took Dave to the airport, and based on Hunter’s recommendation from over a month ago we shared a meal at the Fairmont – delicious!\nThe evening was a shock. Tina and I were not ready for this. Sam, energized by a great meal was not done. As many of you know, Tina often starts to come alive as the sun gets low. So we were off to the [Richmond Night Market](https://richmondnightmarket.com).

Honestly, we also have a little anxiety to make this change and leave the safety of these four wall. But bring it on – let’s get out for a few days!\nAria and family were able to visit again. Aria and Tina hit up a local gluten free bakery. Sam was able to have a short visit with David and Lucas H. and a little longer with David. We are thankful for their friendship.\nIn the evening Tina and I attended a concert! For several years Tina was been dreaming of attending a For King and Country concert and we were able to get tickets. Tina loved it! She also loved huge hugs from Carlene and Kendra S., and Kim P. who happened to be sitting fairly close by!"

Sam, although have a return of energy, is becoming physically exhausted. This whole regime, and being bed-bound for a full week, has led to parts of his system being bound – constipation is significant issue. It will pass but likely not without pain. GI sores from the chemotherapy also complicate this.\nConcern, a recent scan flagged a the potential for a problematic kidney stone.\nUpcoming, this Friday June 2, Sam is books for a PET scans. The purpose of this scan is to determine the current state of the cancer. We look forward to knowing the results. We are excited that previous scans suggest significant reductions in the cancer, and that this scan should confirm that. As always, we will remain concerned about any cancer in his system."

We were excited to receive update pictures from Joel and Joanna C. as they travelled from Prince George with Sam’s good friends Chase and Ben C. Ben of course brought greetings from his family and Sam and I are now set up with our favourite cookies from Krista. We had an initial visit Saturday evening and despite a having to cancel a morning visit on Sunday the boys had great visits again in the afternoon.\nAn expected side effect from the chemotherapy was a drop in Sam’s blood counts. We saw this over the weekend with a full collapse of Sam’s white count on Sunday. This temporary loss of the body’s ability to fight was also paired with a fever and phlegm. The medical team was ready for this and had Sam on antibiotics right away. Visits were cancelled for most of the day as Tina and I watched our boy sleep most of the day away. By later afternoon, Sam was awake and was welcomed visits from Chase and Ben – though masks were needed for all. So good to see these boy / young men back together again – Good for the soul (ours and Sam’s)!"

    "text": "Reflections on this past weekend\n\nJune 3\nOur first full day off. A day of rest and simply exploring the RMH (Ronald McDonald House). We also took care of all the medical items ourselves – medications and needles and NG tube feeding. We had it all down all the steps were going well – until we hit a glitch. We do not have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while in the hospital: The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it back. After working at it for about an hour we decided togive up for the night and pushed as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a hack that sometimes works to dissolve clogs).\nSaturday afternoon1, we had a wonderful visit with Bob and Wendy H. Sam shocked me as he was also up for the visit. Wendy and Tina had a good catch-up, while Bob, Sam, and played on a digital game table. Sam and Bob broke the game after Sam discovered a glitch and they both exploited it.\n\n\nJune 4\nSunday morning the NG remained clogged. We were fairly quick to recognize that this was a blessing! Sam had a new job – to eat and ensure that he met or exceeded the calories that he would have received via the NG tube. He did not disappoint –our boy has his appetite back. About mid-afternoon, Tina pulled the tube.\nAlso in the afternoon we had some great visits. First with Uncle Kevin and then joined by cousins Chris and Jane (Cal’s children). We all chatted and hung out outside. That evening the cousins and the three of us got Sam off hospital property for the first time since this whole journey began! We got out for a meal – at the Kerrisdale White Spot where Sam had a milkshake and a double-double.\n\n\nJune 5\nAnother great day as a family starting with a full breakfast provided by volunteers at the RMH. Times talking together, imagining, drawing – including time outside (outside can be precious following weeks of being in hospital). In the afternoon we grabbed an ride-share down the Marine Gateway Cineplex and took in the new Guardians o the Galaxy movie – loved it!\nThese last few days have felt like a vacation!"

Over this past weekend Sam has had a lot of intense ‘medicines’ pushed into him. I put this in quotes as if we weren’t tackling cancer these medicines would be considered poisons. Along with the medication has been a lot of fluid – resulting in the need to put a lot of fluid out. Sam and I have been awake through the nights every 1-3 hours… I am so glad to see him resting now."

    "text": "Clarifying, from what I understand\nIt really has been encouraging to see Sam come back, the return of his humor, his appetite, desires to do things. This morning, I want to explain my understanding of what has been happening with him. Before arriving, Sam was very sick, having extreme lethargy, and barely able to get out of bed. His body’s immune system was on overdrive in effort to battle what we now know is the cancer. The effect of this was that his whole body inflamed – think of a time that you had a small cut or burn and your skin was red and a little puffy around the injury… now take that idea and apply it to inside Sam’s body, and the majority of the lymphatic system. So why is he so much better now? Why does the treatment seem to be working so well? Is Sam healing?\nTreatment started this past Friday, six days ago, and by the end of Saturday Sam was already feeling much better. This is actually an expected response. I am unclear if how dramatic the response is was expected, but the medical team did expect a fairly rapid response. One of the drugs that is part of Sam chemotherapy prednisone, which can be used to change the way the body ’s immune system reacts – effectively taking the immune system out of overdrive and reducing all that internal swelling.\nSo is Sam getting better? Sam is definitely feeling better and has a much improved quality of life, and I hope and pray that he is getting better in the long term. However, I need to be clear, when it comes to the cancer in his body, we just do not know.\nSam is now scheduled for a scan tomorrow morning. We will know more once those results are in."

We are grateful for all of this.

Sam gets a small injection every 12 hours. Our nursing team might be in competition to see who can deliver with the least pain. Of the last three needles Sam felt one, a bit; didn’t feel one at all; and was tickled by a third. Wow, if we can keep this pattern going that would be amazing. Happy for what we have now.\nSam was able to complete the intake of his intense chemotherapy chemicals. If you have ever been in the health care system for more than a couple days you likely know the importance of … movements. Alex, Sam’s nurse, literally danced for joy as this health moment.

I was really glad to have this conversation, to know what Dr. Chang was thinking, and strategies going forward … but this one also hurt. The major challenge for the medical team is that they still do not know exactly what they are dealing with. This is a cancer, but the specific type of cancer remains unknown.\nGiven that there are unknowns around the type of cancer, there are also unknowns about how it will behave and potentially where it is. Sam needs to have a full-body scan, if an opening in the schedule at the BC Cancer Clinic can be found, and timing on this is essential. The scan needs to happen before treatment starts and the team can only wait so long (i.e. treatment needs to start this week).\n\n\nOn needles\nOver the last month, Sam has not had a good time with needles. Really, I think we can all relate – getting a shot, or having blood taken, is not something any of us enjoy. Sam has taken them on, with blood test after blood test. To make things worse, as Sam entered the hospital system he had to have IV medications, many of which failed. In the last nine IVs he experienced six failed attempts, and three were initially established successful; of those one was accidentally pulled during surgery, one blew, and a last one remains. All this to say needles cause a level of anxiety.\nSam has had a number of days of grace. The PICC line provides easy access, but last night it stopped working, they could not draw blood. If it does not work, then drawing blood via needles will be needed. In a few texts last night, we asked for prayer for this.\n\n\nVictories and comforts\n\nThe small things really do matter! Many thanks to our nurse Pam who made sure that Sam was able to get into the shower today. He came out clean, refreshed, and feeling human!\nI didn’t finish the needle story:\n\nThe doctor changes the order regarding taking blood. So no need for blood last night!\nThis morning I came into the room at 4:45 and both Sam and Tina were full of joy. Sam had just had his blood taken, and no needles were used. The PICC line was working again.\n\nSo where was I coming in from at 5:00am? We now have a home away from home at the Ronald McDonald House, where I had a comfortable, and mostly full night’s sleep.\n\n\n\nNeeds and concerns\nCurrently:\n\nFirm diagnosis of the type of cancer. This will significantly inform treatment.\nPET scan to determine where this disease is and where it is not. Timing is essential on this – the sooner the better.\nThat Sam’s PICC line would continue to function. Ideally, that it could also be used for treatment … either adjustments are needed or another PICC will need to be established as the current one is not ‘centrally located’ (not exactly where they need it to be)."

I would be lying if I said that all of us are feeling great this morning. The reality is that scan days are always stressful as they mark significant chapters in Sam’s treatment. They mark significant pivot points where treatment plans are adjusted – either to keep going with the treatment regime or change it up. Perhaps today’s scan is all the more stressful as it is to determine if one of our last treatment options (immunotherapy combined with a new medication) is working or not. Additionally, being back in Vancouver and being under the watchful eye of our medical team is in stark contrast to the freedom, fun-living, and joy had with friends this past week."

    "text": "An amazing week at home!\nI am still stunned at how good this last week has been! Since my last post:\n\nSaturday\n\nThis day was a turning point. Most of this day and all of the days prior that week Sam had been feeling the effects of his immunotherapy drugs – generally wiped-out/lethargic and achy.\nIn the evening he had a return of energy and the Bandstra, Claus, and Cross families rearranged their plans and came over. We had a great summer evening in the back yard talking and playing games. Sam was especially encouraged receiving the care of friends.\n\nSunday\n\nTina and I made it to church… well we made it in the door and then spent the time connecting with people. Sam slept in that morning but gave me a call asking to come greet people following the service. It was encouraging for all!\n\n\nIn the evening, Sam having heard from his friends the night before about how great working at Ness Lake Bible Camp was, he asked to go and visit – which we did. However, Sam wasn’t satisfied with visiting and by the end of the evening he had spent several hours working in the kitchen or wherever else he was able.\n\n\nMonday\n\nWe figured that Sam would need a rest day – we were wrong! That afternoon Tina took Sam out to camp again where he worked, visited, and took part in cabin time with the kids!\n\n\nThat evening some of the church leaders came by to support and pray with us and for Sam – more encouragement.\n\nTuesday\n\nI spent the morning at work – made it out to the forest. It was great to be there again. Also, to connect with my work-world people!\n\n\nSam was not going to miss out, and he was out to serve at camp again. Tina had expected to take him home at any point, but he stayed until late in the evening! He even had energy for the evening Safari game where leaders dress up as animals and the campers have to hunt them. He had an amazing time. Though a fall during the game resulted in us putting him in an air-cast. An x-ray, if needed, will be completed while we are here in Vancouver. This leg pain was all worth the experience of joining the team.\n\nWednesday\n\nAs a family, we focused on packing up to be ready to head south.\n\n\nSam was thinking he would have a rest day but having received an invite from camp to join in on activities, he was not going to miss out. That evening Sam, although hobbling with the air-cast, took part in work projects, discussion times, and then the end-of-week button ceremony where Sam was awarded two buttons. The encouragement definitely went both ways: camp leaders were so impressed with Sam, while Sam had his heart-bucket filled to overflowing.\n\nFrom Dave Horton’s post:\n\nSam Chisolm earned his summer team shirt and both director pins (which does not happen ever)…\n\nfor serving others (through some physical pain) before himself\nfor going from a visitor to “what can I do to help.”\n\nDude helped with dishes, A team, camper supervision and more. We could not find enough for him to do.\n\n\n\nTina, Sam, and I have been so encouraged by these days that Sam had in camp. It was amazing to see him rise and have the energy to engage. Amazing to see the joy he had. A huge thank you to all of the Ness Lake Crew – thank you for welcoming Sam onto the team!\n\nThursday\n\nWe got away from Prince George in great time. Had a great visit with family in Langley and then settled into the RMH that evening."

Tina and I celebrated our 28th anniversary (love you Tina!) while visiting Nana in White Rock (the Frickers were away). Sam had received his dose of Nivolumab a week earlier and what we now know/remember is that it takes about a week for effects and corresponding pains to set in. One of the hardest things in this whole journey is to watch your child when they are in pain and to not understand what is causing it. Over the next couple days we were able to get his pain under control allowing to feel himself again.\nAlso that weekend, Nana Mary was having some heart related symptoms that gave us a scare – she seems to be good now.\nTo celebrate our anniversary, instead of going out for dinner, Tina and I chose to stay in and eat with our beloved Sam and mother Mary. It was a good evening, despite the uncertainty of everything going on.\n\n\nJuly 6 - 8\nIn addition to waiting for these situations to resolve, one reason that this post is a few days late coming is that this past weekend I was laid flat. A head cold took all my energy for the better part of Saturday through Monday."

The initial attempt to use Nivolumab, at the end of Feb., did not go well and resulted in lost time recovering from side effects (primarily liver inflammation). Currently, the combination of these two drugs seems to be working well – specifically, metrics related to Sam’s liver are stable and even in normal ranges.\nSam also had an MRI of his chest last week the results of which were encouraging. Though it is too soon to tell, or to relate the scan to the latest drug regime, the results indicated that the cancerous mass had not grown (in contrast to the previous PET scan). We are once again hopeful that the cancer can be held back/ controlled. The MRI also provided incredible details of Sam’s upper body and the medical team will continue to review this latest set of images to evaluate future treatment options."

The results of the June12th PET scan simply sucked – the cancer had grown, and likely spread into two lymph nodes close by.\nSo we pivot and move onto the next plan which will be a combination of different immunotherapy drugs. Past research suggest that these drugs could be effective at 1) interrupting a key metabolic pathway in the cancer cells, and 2) disable some of the cancer’s defenses that allow it to hide from the immune system.\nLast Friday we were hoping to see Sam start on this modified immunotherapy drug treatment plan, but it was not safe to do so. Since receiving his BMT1 Sam has had some level of GVHD2. One ongoing effect of GVHD is that fluid has built up around his heart (measured using an echocardiogram). To date this has not impacted his heart function. The challenge and safety concern is that the new immunotherapy treatment will likely intensify GVHD impacts that could put his heart at risk.\nSo instead of treating the cancer, last week Sam was started on a steroid to reduce GVHD effects. Yesterday, a repeat echocardiogram and blood metrics suggest that this GVHD treatment is working and this should allow Sam to start on the immunetherapy/cancer-treatment later this week."

Many thanks to the staff and students at Cedars who welcomed Sam back in and allowed him to engage with his academics.\nHe pushed hard to catch up on a couple topics often spending 2-3 hours a day on homework. … Honestly he had seemed to have more energy than I did.\nThis last Friday, after writing a three hour math test during the day, Sam even attended the school dance.

    "text": "Current medical picture\nThis past Wednesday Sam had his most recent PET scan. Scan days are always stressful. Our experience with this type of stress is not unique. Talking with other parents, we all recognize that scan days and at minimum the day leading up to them are intense. It is weird because the scans do not change anything, but what they do is reveal what is happening. They cause use to confront all that we hope for and all that we fear. To add to this, the results from the scan often do not align with either our hopes or the fears that we try to prepare ourselves for. This dissonance, just adds to the stress of it all.\nThe results of this last scan, like many others, has mixed news.\n\nCancer status\nThe good news is that since Feb 5th there are no new disease sites.\nThe difficult news is that the site in the center of Sam’s chest remains and has grown a small amount. The previous scan, April 5, showed no detectable change at that site and so to have this new growth strongly suggests that the cancer is active there. Options for treatment are limited and it is unknown if they will be effective.\n\n\nLiver status\nThe previous PET scan raised concern that a more metabolically active site in Sam’s liver could be cancer. This has been ruled out via biopsy. We have known for sometime that Sam’s liver has been stressed due to side-effects of his immune therapy treatment causing his immune system to become deregulated. Latest metrics of Sam’s liver health have been improving. Recent ultrasound of the liver shows a minor increase in size. The Doctors want to continue monitoring this mass as it is not an urgent priority right now."

To date we have not had the opportunity to see what it can do. The previous treatments had side-effects that required steroids to calm/ suppress his immune system so that permanent liver damage could be avoided. If he was taken off the immunosupressants and just let his own (new) immune system work, this option would allow Sam to live and enjoy his life without medications and risk of side-effects. However, we do not know if his new immune system will effectively battle the cancer.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Resume immune therapy\nThis option would require the use of Nivomulab (an immune therapy drug) again. We know that this drug can make the cancer in Sam’s body ‘visible’ to the immune system. However, this is also the drug that resulted in Sam’s liver being inflamed and the subsequent need for steroids to calm the immune system (Catch-22). If we go this route, the team would use the lessons learned from last time to modify their therapy plan in an attempt to limit side-effects.\n\nIf side-effects can be avoided, this will likely be the more effective treatment.\nIf side-effects cannot be avoided, this treatment could cause permanent harm (eg. the risk of liver failure)."

The cancer aside, Sam is healthy, regaining weight, growing, and getting stronger.\nIn the last couple of weeks we have been instituting Sam’s foodie-rehab plan. This is where we walk from RMH to the small mall at Oak and King Edward. Once there, Sam has been enjoying most items at Kim’s Express (Vietnamese food). One evening Sam led our family for a larger walk, one that I did not know he was capable of, down to Cambie Village about 1.5kms away. We had some great ice cream before walking back. This was an epic evening for our family.\nOver this past weekend we were able to join some of the Frickers and the Townsend side of the family to experience the animals at Aldor Farms near Ft. Langley. I loved watching Sam take some time to groom Rob, a huge Percheron work horse.\nYesterday, we celebrated Mothers Day. Ronald McDonald House put on a beautiful brunch. In the evening, we took in the Canucks vs. Oilers hockey game (which Sam mostly slept through due to being tired from his big farm day Saturday)."

    "text": "Travel log\nThe initial idea to travel was presented last Wednesday, April 17. However, actual travel plans were dependent on metrics on Sam’s bloodwork that would allow the medical team to decide if it would be safe for Sam to travel. Specifically, if Sam’s numbers were not good on the Friday, we check again on the Monday, and if they were not good then the trip would be cancelled. So to keep things flexible we chose to drive. As a family we have always done road trips and Sam was looking forward to this pilgrimage drive home.\n\nDay 1 – Travel\nSunday, April 21\nWe got away from Vancouver at a good time. It was a cool cloudy day with some showers heading into the Fraser Canyon. We had a great early lunch at Horsting’s Farm near Cache Creek. In the afternoon we stopped to see Renee near Williams Lake. Refreshed and fed we travelled on arriving at my parents as the sun was setting.\nWe received a loving welcome from Mom and Dad and all of us loved seeing Sam reconnect with Buddy – his dog was crazy excited to see him! We were also able to catch the last two periods of the first Vancouver vs. Nashville playoff game.\n\n\nDay 2 – Family\nMonday\nThis was really the only day that we had any sort of plan which was to make family our priority. The earlier part of the day was spent with my parents and the evening with Tom, Margaret, Daniel and Alex. Good times connecting, talking, and playing games together.\n\n\nDay 3 – School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam loved reconnecting with his friends at school and later at youth group!\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\nWe let this day be driven by Sam and how he was feeling – he was feeling good. Mid-morning Sam had a great idea of visiting his friends at school over the lunch break. It was so good to see him simply slip into life at the school. We ended up spending the entire afternoon there as Sam joined in to classes. Tina and I connected with staff and a number of friends as parents rolled in for afterschool pickup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4 – Whirlwind\nWednesday\nWednesday was more of a whirlwind. Sam had an appointment at the hospital pediatric clinic. This was our first connection with the Prince George team. Although they do not specialize in cancer treatment it was good to see how much ca be taken care of at the hospital back home. In the afternoon we squeezed in some visits with friends and dinner with the grandparents. In the evening Sam was able to attend youth group at the church!\n\n\n\n\nDay 5 – Return to Vancouver\nThursday\nWe had to head back to Vancouver. It was a great road trip. Sam is looking forward to the day when he can be the driver. In the meantime he watched the road and acted as a good copilot.\nIt was a great first trip home and hopefully our next one will be in the near future and with more days at home."

    "text": "Cancer war\nBelow I attempt to convey the latest biopsy results and what this means for Sam’s cancer treatment. I suggest taking it slow. The picture is complicated as we now how two issues to resolve – the liver, and the cancer.\n\nInitial biopsy results\nLast Wednesday, Sam had a biopsy of his a growth in his liver, and yesterday we received some preliminary results. The good news is that this new growth is not Sam’s original cancer! However, we do not yet know definitively what it is – that will need to wait for the full report. What we do know is that this growth is likely a source of dangerous agitation of Sam’s liver, and that it needs to be treated. It is now believed that the source of ongoing agitation to the liver is the on-going de-regulation of Sam’s immune system … effectively GVHD though it can be debated if this is the right term.\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch-22\n\n… a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are in ‘catch-22’ situation. The new site in Sam’s liver immune system needs to be brought under control as it is likely the major source of ongoing agitation to Sam’s liver. This is indicated in Sam’s regular bloodwork where various chemicals indicative of liver health and function are dangerously high. The best chemical method for treating growths like this involve using steroids (i.e. Prednisone) – Sam is currently on these. Initial efforts to bring the immune system in-check used steroid (i.e. Prednisone). However, the steroids have shown themselves to only be partially effective and an alternate drug therapy has been initiated.\nHowever, this steroidal treatment suppresses the immune system.\nIn the treatment of Sam’s cancer we have been using drugs to cause Sam’s immune system to be hyperactive (i.e. the opposite of suppressed). As such we are in a catch-22 situation. To treat the liver we must suppress the immune system, to treat the cancer we must make the immune system hyperactive1.\n…Ughhh…\nThe imaging from this morning’s ultrasound, April 16, suggested that the mass in the liver is stable and likely benign – it will be monitored but no further action is currently needed. Medical actions will focus on bringing the immune system under control.should provide the medical team enough new information to determine how the current treatment is working and what alternate treatment options may exist.\nI think what much of this comes down to may simply be timing.\n\nTreat the liver quickly.\nWith the liver treated we can return to the immune therapy of the cancer.\n\nOnce the liver agitation is resolved (or mostly resolved). We can return to managing Sam’s cancer.\n\n\nHope and anxiety\n\nHope\n\nIf there is anything exciting from all of this it is that the new site is not Sam’s original cancer. This means that Sam’s cancer has been stable since the treatments following the PET scan back in February. This also means that the BMT-immune therapy treatment combination seems to be working.\n\nAnxiety\n\nIn waiting for the liver agitation issue to be resolved we are delaying immune therapy treatments for the cancer. During this period it is possible that Sam’s original cancer could get going again."

No further immune therapy treatments have happened as we are waiting for Sam’s immune system to return to normal/safe levels. The initial treatment ramped-up Sam’s immune system, ideally to fight the cancer, but a side effect has been that the immune system is running on the edge of out-of-control causing graft versus host disease and agitating his liver. So we wait. At clinic yesterday, we changed meds to slow the immune system down/ bring it under control.\nDuring this waiting period he have seen Sam generally been lethargic with some itchiness related to graft versus host disease. It is unclear what causes the lethargy in Sam, it could be effects of the radiation or immune therapy, it could be the disease, all of the above or something else … We do get glimpses of the real Sam full of energy and life. These times are encouraging though it is hard to watch him drop back to lethargy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4 addition\n\n\n\nIn the last 3-4 days Sam has had much better energy… I hope it continues.\n\n\nGenerally, we are in a very ambiguous situation – not knowing what is happening with the cancer or if the treatments are having the desired effects. Sam will have a PET scan tomorrow (Friday, April 5) which should give us a picture of where things are at.\n\n\nLiving life and special memories\nThe previous two weeks have been busy. In adddition to medical appointments we had good visits with friends, family, and we attended a couple hockey games.\n\nFriends and family\nWe have been encouraged by visits with friends. Most importantly – Sam’s friends. It was spring break for the schools and a few friends were able to visit during this time.\nChase came and stayed with us/Sam for a number of days. Ben, along with the rest of his family, was able to visit a couple different times. I am thankful that these boys were able see Sam when he was up and when he was down and simply accept him where he was at.\nWe also love the times we can connect with family, here at the RMH, at their homes, and at a hockey game.\n\n\nHockey\nSam has really been enjoying hockey during this difficult period. He looks forward to watching games. Since I last wrote we were able to attend two.\nFirst, we attended the WHL’s Vancouver Giants versus Kelowna Rockets. This was a special family time as we were gifted box seats to the game. Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the three of us plus Chase there.\nThis past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with a party atmosphere at the arena!"

We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge him to leave hospital after one night.\nOn Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam’s back (T3 vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is in the exact same position during treatment – ensuring that the upcoming treatment is very precise.\nCompared with my previous post, Sam’s health and pain levels have been quite stable with no significant pain spikes."

Programs here at the Ronald McDonald House have been helpful. Sam has taken to playing the drums – I don’t know where he gets his rhythm from but he is a natural. I have enjoyed playing and learning a few new things on guitar. Tina has made it to a couple painting classes. We have also been able to connect with a number of other families including playing some board games together.\nWe are encouraged by visitors, Grace and Darren from Prince George, Tina’s Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth originally from England but now in Abbotsford, and Tina’s family: siblings, Nana Mary, and Sam’s cousins are all in the Lower Mainland and we see some of them weekly.\nOne highlight from this past week was that we have moved to a larger room.

The upside is he has a new immune system to battle it. The downside, well it is a cold that is taking energy from him – energy we want him to have to battle the cancer.\nThe cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam’s body.\nNew battle strategies have been developed but carry some higher risks.\n\nThe new immunotherapy drugs will release Sam’s immune system to hit harder. Though we look forward to this pushing the cancer back, side effects of the new immune system attacking healthy tissues are also big concern.\n\nWe are thankful that Sam has not had any adverse reactions to this drug. The next dose will be double the first so concerns remain.\nTargeted radiation therapy begins next week. We are thankful this tool can be used to reduce the burden of disease on Sam. However, radiation also comes with risks.\n\nWe very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation We cannot thank you enough.\nWe are thankful to the medical team who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great confidence.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nThere is always concern that the cancer remains.

Results of the biopsy are expected following this coming weekend.\nThis afternoon we will meet with the radiation oncologist to discuss treatment options using radiation. I expect this will cover at least two scenarios: First, an emergency scenario should the cancer starts in Sam’s back begin to impact nerve function. Second, a scenario that could be more therapeutic assuming the cancer is slow enough growing that it does not require emergency action. … the second scenario should be less dangerous.\nFriday we will be back in clinic to debrief and complete standard health checks.\nSam remains courageous. He understands everything that is going on. He knows his life is at risk. Yet he remains courageous, hopeful, trusting, and faithful.\nThe afternoon of the 14th Tina and I met with Sam’s doctor to discuss the results Sam’s PET scan – completed earlier in the day. The results were not what we hoped for – the cancer remains and has spread. Though we were initially shocked, disappointed, and honestly scared, the three of us have rallied and are preparing to take on this next fight."

I felt ground-to-dust. And yet notes of support and care started to roll in. When you reach out and express your care, your solidarity, and your prayers, you are the hands and feet and face of Christ to us.\nPlease continue to reach out to us – we need you. Please ask your children to reach out to Sam so that he knows he is not alone. Let him know that he is missed and that they are praying/ caring for him despite the physical distance. Many thanks to those who have reached out already and especially to Sam’s friends for reaching out to him.\nThe initial feeling of having our world rocked have shifted. As a family we have spent time encouraging each other and praying together. We have rallied – we are ready to take on this next cancer battle."

    "text": "PET scan results\nAlthough busy with regular clinic check-ins, we have had to bide our time since Sam received his bone marrow transplant – 93 days ago. Imaging has had to wait as there was so much going on in Sam’s body it was not possible to get a new image of the state of the cancer. Our assumptions and our hopes were that the prior treatments would have set the cancer back and that the new immune system would then attack anything that remains. However, the PET scan revealed a more complex picture.\n\nOriginal cancerous mass\nImagery of the original mass suggested that the radiation therapy destroyed much of the cancer and likely that there is an on-going war between Sam’s new immune system and the remaining disease. The imagery of this site looks like a solar eclipse – with no activity in the middle, where the radiation focused, but with high activity/avidity around the edges.\n\n\nNew sites\nPerhaps more alarming is that cancer is now active in new areas of Sam’s body. There are three new locations, all of which appear to be within bones (something we have not seen before). Working bottom-up, new sites of cancer are located in Sam’s\n\nleft shin (tibia) slightly below his knee\nhip (right ilium)\nback (T3 vertebrae, between his shoulder blades)\n\nNone of these are currently causing any additional impacts (e.g. bones are still strong, and no nerve impacts). Sam does have some back pain which is likely related to the spot there. These new sites raise questions and there will be a flurry of activity as plans of attack are made."

Next up:\n\nCompleted, Feb 16 morning: CT scan of the T3 vertebrae to assess risk and provide imaging that will assist with treatment planning.\nCompeted, Feb 16: Discussion with with the Orthopedic surgery team to discuss/plan a biopsy of the cancer in Sam’s shin (the easiest of the new sites to access). This was completed by our medical team and it was determined that this biopsy would not be feasible.\nFeb 22: An alternate option is scheduled to biopsy the new cancer in Sam’s back.\nCompleted, Feb 16: Discussion with Radiation Oncologist to discuss new radiation based treatments. Our medical team has been in communication with them and the Radiation team is ready when and if needed.\nOngoing: reduce medications that have kept Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) in-check. Increasing GVHD may help in the battle to kill the cancer … though this will need to be monitored closely to ensure Sam’s good tissues are not damaged.\n\nIt has not even been 48 hours since we received the PET scan results and I hope you can sense that things are moving quickly – action is being taken.\nAlthough there is a lot going on we were also able to get out and enjoy life."

    "text": "Feb. 9, 2024\n\n\n\nJust a quick update as we continue on this journey.\nThis treatment recovery phase seems long. I shouldn’t be surprised by this, all journeys seems long when you are nearing the end. It is always that last couple hours of a long drive that seem the longest.\nIn this situation, Sam has had some incredible things done to him. The pace of activities and medical interventions has slowed drastically, and Sam’s health is continuing to move in the right direction. His strength and stamina are returning/rebuilding. Sam still struggles with some pain but it has shifted from deep bone pains related to the chemical treatments to muscle pains as he rebuilds his core strength. Everything is moving in the right direction and returning home is getting closer!\nIt has been a good week. Sam has had a distinct return of his appetite and with it he is growing in strength. The discipline of choosing hope, discussed in my last post, has been getting easier given that we are not faced with so many unknowns and anxieties are being replaced with relief.\nOn the medical side, Sam’s medical team is happy to see him regaining capacity. Clinic appointments are becoming less frequent (we are transitioning from 2-3 times per week to just once), and the repeat of the baseline medical testing has been ongoing. Sam should get is central-line removed within the next two weeks.\nNow, our thoughts are turning towards home and what it will mean to return there. Our current expectation is to return near the end of February. Returning will not be as simple as jumping back into life like-it-was. Sam’s immune system, though getting stronger, will still be compromised – the team here suggests that it will take a year before his immune system is back to full-strength. His stamina is building but we will need to guard his capacity. What does this mean practically? I am not sure, but here are a couple guesses: visits will need to be individual or in small groups and we will still need to avoid crowds – at least with Sam. Sam’s diminished strength may mean that visits are short and that he simply powers-out partway through. The return to normal will be in small steps … but we are getting there!\nIt is amazing to think of returning home. Returning to friends and family – we have missed you! It is also amazing to start counting down days! For long time we counted up – not knowing when the end would be. Now the end is in sight! Sam has made it through all of his treatments and it feels like we are on an exit-ramp – we can start preparing for home!"

Where prior Jan. 1st Sam had increasing stamina and activity levels, this past week-and-a-half he had no energy and spent most days in bed. The virus we all had complicated the picture. We did have a couple clinic appointments but making any changes were difficult as it was hard to know what was happening in Sam’s body apart from the illness.\n\n\nLast Wednesday there was a decision to stop one of the steroids used during BMT. Initially, this did not seem to affect Sam … but at the time all he was doing was sleeping (&gt;90% of the time). By the end of the weekend, Sam was mostly done with the cold but he was still sleeping… and not very responsive. It turns out the steroid was a chemical crutch and we had pulled in out from under him.\n\n\nThe next clinic appointment, earlier this week, a substitute steroid was introduced. Sam is now more conscious and is beginning to get moving again.\n\nThe positive\n\nDespite the confusion and challenges above Sam has made some good progress having successfully dropped a number of medications from his list.\n\n\nSymptoms of GVHD have been minimal with minor rashes.

This was the first morning Sam did not need to ride in the chair (Dec. 22nd)!\n\n\n\n\nSam continues to have regular visits at the clinic. Various blood tests are done each time. One specific, the team looks at Tacrolimus levels, an immunosuppressant used to ensure that this BMT is successful and that any graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is minimized. Note: some GVHD is needed so that the new immune system continues to attack any remaining cancer.\nExciting news! The genetic testing of Sam’s immune system confirmed that the donor cells have fully replaced Sam’s native immune system. Ideally, in a BMT transplant the native immune system is removed to make way for the donor cells. There is always a chance that some native cells remain and that a battle for dominance can occur. For Sam, the BMT has gone as planned and all new blood is being generated by the donor cells.\nAll of the blood tests have shown Sam’s counts have come up and are stabilizing.\nI have debated including this next thought … especially during Christmas. It is a challenging reality (skip it if you need to).\n\nSkipRead\n\n\nor click ‘Read’ above\n\n\nChristmas at the Ronald McDonald House is amazing but strange – layered in hope and pain. There is so much generosity poured into this place you cannot help but feel cared for.\n\nDuring these last months, as we have weathered this cancer storm, we have also walked beside a number of other families in similar circumstances. Some are looking forward to completing treatment, while others are in the thick of the storm. Another family, is having an incredibly hard Christmas. They have reached the end of possible treatments and recently moved to hospice to spend what days remain with their child. Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to them.\n\nHere at the Ronald McDonald House joys and pains are especially visible. For me, this raises an inescapable question for life at home. If your Christmas is full of joy, and I truly hope it is, are there pains that may be close but remain unseen? Is there a way to demonstrate love and generosity into those situations?\n\n\n\nSome good normal life has been happening.\n\nSam has had energy to enjoy reading. He finished The Hobbit earlier this week and immediately got into another book.\nNana was able to visit and help us prepare for Christmas.\nWe were able to get off the hospital campus and visit the Frickers – with more family visits planned over the holidays. So great to play family games… this year games also includes some VR which actually has been an amazing physical rehabilitation tool."

A strong indicator that the transplant is taking hold!\nWe very thankful for the successful delivery of the donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation I cannot thank you enough.\nThankful that what Sam has experienced so far is within the normal for a BMT and that he has not had any complications. Although it is all in the ‘normal’, it is not all easy:\n\nNausea is under control! We have seen the reduction of meds and will be testing removal of some anti-nausea meds. Impacts from the pre-treatment, chemotherapy and radiation, remain strong. These cause deep bone and muscle pain, along with nausea. These are starting to resolve!\nPain management is under control! Sam is on a regular dose of morphine which he will start reducing over the weeks ahead.\nNutrition mainly by mouth and I expect the NG tube will be removed in the next few days.\nEnergy levels are returning! – it is great to see Sam roam the halls!\n\nWe are thankful to the medical team who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great confidence.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nSam will still be considered immune compromised for the months ahead and mostly susceptible to viral infection. It remains to be flu season and covid is still out there. We must continue to be vigilant to protect Sam.\nWe are thankful for all of the messages of encouragement and solidarity that we have received from all of you.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains.

Here is what I currently understand:\n\nWe will be watching for the day the BMT is officially considered engrafted (3 consecutive days of ANC \\(\\geq 0.5\\)).\nSam will begin a step-down process as his body heals from the intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy that was used to condition his body to receive the transplant. Currently, he receiving significant external supports: nutrition is being delivered via NG tube and TPN (IV delivery), and he is on a continuous schedule of numerous drugs. In the step down process these supports will slowly be removed, and drugs will be converted to oral delivery.\nOver the next couple months Sam will be watched closely for signs of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD)– essentially that the new immune system does not harm Sam.\nWe should be out of hospital and back the Ronald McDonald House before Christmas."

They are satisfied with how Sam is doing as everything seems to be progressing normally. Medical orders from this team tend to address issues with:\n\nblood – as blood counts will continually drop until the graft takes. Sam has received and will receive numerous transfusions in the weeks ahead.\nbowels – mucositis has once again and as expected impacted Sam’s entire digestive track. However, where things were previously too slow now they are too fast.\nThey also keep a watchful eye with daily physical exams.\n\nThe Acute Pain Services (APS) doctors visits 1-2 times per day. By the end of the previous six rounds of chemotherapy the suite of drugs was causing a lot of pain deep in Sam’s bones and muscles. In preparation, for the BMT Sam received higher doses of chemotherapy than he ever had previously. The APS ensures Sam is as comfortable as possible. Often his base pain management drugs are increased to match increasing pain levels.\nA Nutritionist is here usually daily on weekdays. Sam receives his nutrition in a variety of ways. Eating is limited due to side effects of all the treatments but he still gets a little down. NG food delivery took a little while to get going but is going well now. Sam also receives TPN which is nutrition in a bag pumped directly into his bloodstream.\nPhysiotherapy regularly visits through the week. Providing exercises that are suited to how well Sam is feeling. Exercises range from squats and stretches outside the bed to simple muscle activations when he is too tired to leave the bed."

On a regular basis alarms are going off (e.g. completion of a drug delivery, air-in-line).

Tina and I are also Sam’s first line of assistance – calling nurses when alarms sound, and assisting Sam in an out of bed. Sam’s big task for each day is to have complete his shower. This is a chore and he needs to bring his IV system with him and it can burn the majority of his available energy.\nWhen there are no task to do and when Sam is awake we are simply there to be with him: sit beside him, watch a show together, talk, and Sam often asks for prayer. Yesterday, Sam was able to enjoy watching the Vancouver vs. Seattle hockey game.\nHow are we doing? I think… tired but hopeful. This journey is exhausting at many levels and for Sam most of all. But we are also encouraged with how everything is progressing. It is like when you are on a long journey and the last hours of that journey seem to always take the longest. Or if you are hiking through the mountains, when you cross the final ridge and you can see home but is is still a long way to get there. The big tasks have now been done. We look forward, knowing that we will get back, but there are many miles still ahead."

Everything is going well as Sam has not had any reactions to these currently foreign cells – cells that will become his own. He should have all finish reciving the material in the next twenty minutes. Sam is sleeping through it all.\nToday is the day and Sam is ready!\nSam had a couple rough days leading up to today but he is now comfortable, settled into the the isolation room, and ready to take on the BMT. The actual transplant will happen later today and should be rather anti-climatic. The transplant is similar to receiving blood the difference being that the material in the bag will be bone marrow stem cells. These cells will take up residence in Sam’s bone marrow and start generating new blood – transplanted blood providing a new immune system.\nYesterday went well. The greatest challenge was moving Sam across the hall. It sounds simple but I was wiped out by the end of the day. In moving over everything had to be sterilized. Most items were thoroughly wiped, and placed in clean containers. Laundry had to be re-done as I had not washed the clothes to BMT clean standards. The medical team also had a big task taking all of the furniture out of the room, sterilized the room, and then they cleaned and sterilized each piece of furniture before returning it.\nSam’s isolation room is similar to the other rooms here on the ward. It has his medical bed, a recliner chair and a fold down couch/bed for Tina and I. The difference is that there is a small anteroom. This room has two sets of glass sliding doors. One door leads to the ward and the other to Sam’s room. Only one door is allowed to be open at one time to ensure that the air in Sam’s room is clean. In the anteroom we clean any items before they are passed into the room. It also in this room that we put on gowns to cover out ‘dirty’ outside world clothing. It is actually much simpler for Tina and I to leave and enter than I had expected.\nYesterday’s highlights was seeing friends. Sam was able to visit with Ben while Tina and I visited with David and Krista C. – following their visit Sam moved to the isolation room. In the evening Uncle Cal stopped was able to wave at Sam through the window. Senga and Tina were also able visit."

Sam even had a burst of hyper energy in the evening and literally ran around the ward - excited to have completed the radiation phase.\n\n\nNana, Kevin, Shannon, and Kaden were able to come by for a visit. Nana is staying with Tina at the RMH for a few days – great to have her support!\n\nSaturday fist day of immune and chemo therapies (day -3)\n\nSam’s immune suppression therapy began. It started with bringing in the big IV tower – it currently has 8 IV pumps with room to expand. Sam will have to push, pull, and drag this thing around for the next month or more. With the IV tower in place the immune therapy began. Numerous drugs were administered through the day. Later in the evening Sam received his chemotherapy drugs. So what’s all this mean for Sam?\n\nNew therapies bring new and weird sensations. All of it causes fatigue. The return to chemotherapy is a hard reminder of how these drugs make his body ache and pain management becomes more challenging. I also recognize that while outside of the hospital we had incredible flexibility in pain management. The medical team at Canuck Place were able to consult with us at any time and had given us a lot of tools to manage pain. Here at the hospital it is more difficult as specific orders need to be written and the nurses are generally restricted to those orders. … changing them in the middle of the night on a long weekend can be done. It just not very easy."

    "text": "The Chisholm family at the Ronald McDonald House. Fall 20231.\nSam is a courageous champion! He has now endured and completed two types of cancer treatment, and is ready to take-on the upcoming bone marrow transplant (BMT). Over the past six months Sam’s treatments have focused on attacking the cancer cells within his body. He received six rounds of chemical chemotherapy between May and Oct. Over the last two weeks, following the completion of the initial chemotherapy treatment, tactics were changed to use radiation therapy against the largest detectable cancerous mass that remains in the center of his chest. The upcoming BMT will mark a significant change in strategy for removing the cancer. Instead of attacking the cancer directly the BMT will provide a long-term indirect assault on the cancer (long-term being life-long). This process will replace Sam’s immune system – removing his current native immune defenses and replacing them with a donated immune system. Where Sam’s immune system was not effective at detecting and attacking the cancer it is expected that the new immune system will. This process is not easy and Sam may face his greatest challenges to date. However, he is looking forward to completing these next phases.\nThere are currently 8 days until Sam receives the actual transplant. However, there are numerous steps/procedures to be completed to prepare his body for this process. This Wednesday he starts these steps."

    "text": "This past week\n\nTreatment\nIt is amazing to me how a short medical appointment can dominate an entire day. Monday through Friday this past week marked Sam’s second and final week of targeted radiation therapy to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. The actual procedure was usually not more than 15 minutes but it would dominate out entire day. Each day we would get ready, load up and head down to the BC Cancer clinic, a short drive away. Tina and Sam would check in while I attempted to find parking – there were a few days where Sam was done before I was able to park the van. Following treatment we would return to the RMH. Sam has generally felt well though with increasing fatigue. His medical team is happy with his current health: He is an otherwise healthy young man, but with cancer.\nWe may never know the full impact that the radiation will have on the cancer. The radiation therapy can take weeks to show measurable impacts but by that point we will be well into the BMT process. I expect next scans to evaluate the various treatments and the state of the cancer will not be feasible until into the new year.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe were able to visit with and be encouraged by some family and friends this past week. Aunt Tricia put on an amazing meal. Uncle Cal paid a visit. Sam was able to have some time hanging out with cousin Kaden, while Tina and I visited with Kevin, Shannon, and Nana. Yesterday John, Jess, Kate, and John Jr. stopped by for a few hours. Tina was able to have and afternoon away visiting with her cousins in Abbotsford."

These treatments include:\n\nTotal body radiation\nBMT Chemotherapy – intense chemo-drug therapy\nImmune suppression drugs\nThe BMT transplant\n\nSee the previous post or The Plan for the details.\nFollowing the BMT medical efforts will focus on managing Sam’s day-to-day health and finding the balance of facilitating successful engraftment while suppressing graft-versus-host-disease impacts. To complicate matters symptoms of graft-versus-host-disease are easily confused or even synonymous with the flu, colds, or other infections which he will also be highly susceptible to – the medical team will have to be highly vigilant."

If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nIt has been amazing to see Sam out from under the influence of chemotherapy. To see him return to strength of mind and to have capacity for more activity.\nWe have completed a major chapter in Sam’s treatment. With the completion of this last/ sixth round of chemotherapy and targeted radiation. We now pivot to the bone marrow transplant – this next treatment brings hope of removal of the disease but also anxiety about both the challenging process and the potential for long term side effects. We hope and pray that this treatment will be effective in beating the cancer for life.\nIt is flu season and covid is still out there. In the weeks ahead, as a family, we will be more cautious to reduce our risk of getting ill. If any of us get sick in the weeks ahead it will add challenges to Sam and the BMT process as he will be entering a phase where he has no immune system for weeks.\nWe are continually thankful for our medical teams here. They continue to provide incredible care. They are always open to conversation and answering questions. They have been incredibly pro-active and I am glad we are prepared for the next steps.\nThankful that the chemotherapy has been effective at initially reducing the cancer and keeping the cancer contained (as indicated by the PET scan). Thankful that these results allow us to move forward.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:\n\nDue to some timing and logistics we have had to change donors. We are thankful for this current donor who will provide a peripheral blood sample and is a good match for Sam.\nWe are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects long term.\nThe medical team has a huge coordination task ahead of them. From our meetings with them it seems all of the pieces are coming together, but with so many moving parts it is easy for things go wrong.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

They have found a single reference to it, but that has only provided a little guidance.\nThe medical team is battling hard for Sam and their strategies to date have initially reduced, and more recently kept the cancer from growing. However, compared with known cancers this cancer has not responded as well as any of us have wanted."

    "section": "Not an ideal plan",
    "text": "Not an ideal plan\nWe are moving forward with a bone-marrow-transplant (BMT), but we are not in an ideal situation. Ideally, and for best results, when moving to BMT the medical team would like the cancer to be non-detectable. With Sam, starting from where he was back in April, the cancerous mass has been reduced in size, but a significant mass remains. It is not operable as it is in the lymphatic system; although it can be located, as I understand it, it is too amorphous and intertwined within his healthy tissues and bear vital organs (e.g. heart and lungs).\n\nChallenges ahead\nIn the weeks ahead Sam will be facing a number of challenges (see The Plan).\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

Great to have them here and have their in-person support.\n\nSam’s Energy\n\nWe have not seen Sam have this much energy since well before we left home. The cancer has been set back and he has had a week long break between treatments. It definitely shows how the chemotherapy has been relentless.\n\n\nSam has had renewed energy to take on some academics, to build Lego, to tease his parents (…I am happy about that? Right?…). So good to see him have more physical and mental capacity."

But things have not gone as planned, and this is just one more step in the effort to rid Sam’s body of cancer."

Will we respond courageously and act rightly/ virtuously? Or do we react in frustration – and further fuel the storm1? Sam has been incredibly courageous. Facing this storm, this terrifying storm, and he has chosen courage. Not that he has never felt fear. Rather, courage is not the absence of fear, it is choosing to face it."

I was not only wrestling with this cancer storm, I wrestled with my worldview at the core of my being; the foundations of how I interpret life have been shaken to the core. I wrestled with God – where is my God who saves. I have faced Despair and I had moments where I felt that beast would take me.\nI am no longer there. I have faced the beast Despair. And I now walk with new energy and freedom. It is not by my own power that I have overcome. I am still processing all the layers that have come together to provide this victory2. Numerous pieces have come together including snippets of conversations, the example of another family, concepts from a good book, and some additional experiences.\nA simplification of some lessons learned:\n\nCancer is evil.\nGod is good.\nThere is hope.\nDespite this storm we are able to live the good life.\nI am intentionally leaving this undefined for now, and leave it for you to wrestle with."

This included them visiting us here and us making a couple trips out to their trailer in Ft. Langley to enjoy the last of summer camping. One afternoon while Sam had time with his grandparents Tina and I had some time to roam Ft. Langley together. Another afternoon I took Buddy for a short hike to Tavistock View Point on McMillan Island.\n\n\nYesterday evening Tina was filled with joy having a chance to play with her nieces Jane, Amanda, and great-niece Jayme (Amanda’s daughter), at the campsite playground."

Although each story is unique we find solidarity and some levels of comfort and council in the sharing of similarities in the struggle. Over time these families are becoming friends.\nSam remains in good spirits about the upcoming process (i.e. bone-marrow-transplant). He knows it will be tough but he also knows that there is hope in completing this plan. It is hard to see him carry all of this. He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged.\nChemotherapy continues to take its toll. His energy levels are lower with each round. As we enter round 6 Sam’s strength has been diminished. He needs strength for the journey ahead.\nIn preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:\n\nWe are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam. We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process. One option is to just receive blood but the better option is to receive marrow. The latter, receiving marrow, is far better for Sam but involves a intense procedure for the donor.\nSide effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects.\nThe medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them. That all the pieces fall into place for the best timing possible.\n\nWe are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for your notes of encouragement.\nWe are thankful for Sam’s school who are looking forward to his return and who are willing to work with us once Sam is able. We are thankful for his classmates who wrote him and sent him gifts.\nThere is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

He still has the strength to walk but not the energy. During these visits Sam’s blood levels are checked as the chemotherapy drugs knock them back, and we need to be sure he does not get knocked back too hard. The results of the tests came back and his hemoglobin and platelet numbers were low enough that he would have to spend an addition three hours in clinic receiving transfusions… but this time was worth it.\nIt is amazing what some additional blood can do. Following the clinic Sam walked most of the way back to the RMH. He took the stairs. He enjoyed dinner. He wanted to wrestle and he spent lots of energy teasing us. … So good to see our Sam be himself!"

However:\nThe challenge with all of these plans is that we are in unknown territory. I stated early on that Sam’s cancer is very rare. The reality is that it is essentially unknown. In the world, there has been only one other documented case of this form of cancer. So, all of these plans are based in professional judgement/ best-guess. We are thankful for our medical team that is able provide guidance, but we recognize that there is no standard protocol for Sam’s cancer.\nWe have a long list of new concerns which I am yet to process. Top of mind:\n\nAlthough it seems there are good matches for Sam, a donor needs to be willing to make a donation, and all the logistics of timing and delivery need to come together.\nSide effects both immediate and long-term would be limited.

Currently, the family is sleeping (Sam, Tina, and Nana)and we don’t have to give any meds for almost two hours.\nVery little new information yet. We have had a couple more conversations, and met another doctor. There are definitely a lot of moving parts happening in the background as the various teams need to coordinate schedules and activities.\nMoving forward I expect the next couple weeks will become busier and busier. On top of the regular clinic check in days there will be lots of tests to complete, and medical teams to meet. The post below still covers the bulk of what we know.\nThis morning, August 26, I am writing from Sam’s hospital room. He is here for the planned delivery of his fifth round of chemotherapy. Sam is sleeping well. I slept ‘ok’ but my mind has been busy as I process the results and recommendations from yesterday.\nYesterday we reviewed the results of the latest PET scan with Sam’s oncologist and clinical nurse. The good news is that the cancerous masses have been reduced further and that there is no new cancer. The challenge is that the rate of reduction in Sam’s cancer will not be enough to see it removed by the end of either this or the next round. We must consider further treatment options.\nFollowing his current treatment Sam will most likely transition to a bone-marrow-transplant treatment protocol. This will involve:\nAmazingly, we already know that there a several good transplant matches for Sam!\nThere will be many meetings upcoming as new plans are made, and as we transfer his care to the bone-marrow transplant team. Although this is hard, I don’t think we would have been satisfied with anything less. This is the best option for Sam and it should provide life-long defense against this cancer."

However, maintenance issues caused this scan to be postponed – hopefully Sam can get in this Wednesday.\nThe rest of the week was focused on the management of Sam’s side-effects. We have had to be very strict with the scheduling his medications this round. We have seen decent success in managing his nausea and some success in managing his pain. Sam’s energy levels have been low, and his bone ache as his marrow is in full production mode to restore the blood that was destroyed in this last round of chemo."

We were also able to discuss results of last week’s PET scan and lumbar puncture.\nNote: Sam is receiving additional monitoring (i.e. more scans) then normal because his case is … not a normal cancer case. Since so little is known about this form of cancer additional monitoring is taking place. I expect this is for two purposes. First to confirm that the treatment is working. Second, to document that the treatment is working – adding to the pool of knowledge on cancer."

The majority of the days have been within the hospital campus, and over the last week we were able to spread our wings a little further as Sam’s immune system strengthened.\nThough the lived experience of this round felt better, tests this week will determine what the unseen impacts were on the cancer. Sam will have a lumbar puncture and a PET scan over the next few days.\nNext week Sam will return for some hospital days to begin round 3 of chemotherapy which, given it’s chemical makeup, may be harder on him then this last round."

As such, though there may be some similarities with other chemotherapies this is Sam’s – and really it is the only one that I can speak to.\nConsidering chemotherapy in days and weeks:\nFollowing a round of chemotherapy Sam, well all of us, will get a few days of a break … before starting this pattern all over again.\nThis is written on day 4 of 21.

Even now, when home seems so far away, they are preparing us to be there. Maybe it is weird but I enjoyed this – taking on a new challenge and also caring for my boy.\nV., Sam’s physiotherapist, is thrilled with how improved he is, and the strength that he is regaining. She has provided additional tools to keep him moving – a stationary bike, and the next day some resistance bands and weights.\nThe next morning was more routine filled with various drug deliveries and fluids testing.

    "text": "Reflections on this past weekend\n\nJune 3\nOur first full day off. A day of rest and simply exploring the RMH (Ronald McDonald House). We also took care of all the medical items ourselves – medications and needles and NG tube feeding. We had it all down all the steps were going well – until we hit a glitch. We do not have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while in the hospital: The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it back. After working at it for about an hour we decided togive up for the night and pushed as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a hack that sometimes works to dissolve clogs).\nSaturday afternoon1, we had a wonderful visit with Bob and Wendy H. Sam shocked me as he was also up for the visit. Wendy and Tina had a good catch-up, while Bob, Sam, and played on a digital game table. Sam and Bob broke the game after Sam discovered a glitch and they both exploited it.\n\n\nJune 4\nSunday morning the NG remained clogged. We were fairly quick to recognize that this was a blessing! Sam had a new job – to eat and ensure that he met or exceeded the calories that he would have received via the NG tube. He did not disappoint –our boy has his appetite back. About mid-afternoon, Tina pulled the tube.\nAlso in the afternoon we had some great visits. First with Uncle Kevin and then joined by cousins Chris and Jane (Cal’s children). We all chatted and hung out outside. That evening the cousins and the three of us got Sam off hospital property for the first time since this whole journey began! We got out for a meal – at the Kerrisdale White Spot where Sam had a milkshake and a double-double.\n\n\nJune 5\nAnother great day as a family starting with a full breakfast provided by volunteers at the RMH. Times talking together, imagining, drawing – including time outside (outside can be precious following weeks of being in hospital). In the afternoon we grabbed an ride-share down the Marine Gateway Cineplex and took in the new Guardians o the Galaxy movie – loved it!\nThese last few days have felt like a vacation!"

There was also enough information in the image that Dr. Cheng could provide a preliminary report: the tumour is smaller than shown in the previous CT scan (taken after round 1 of chemo). We are headed in the right direction – round 1 saw a reduction in the cancerous mass, and round 2 appears to be doing the same! We will know better in with the next scan in a couple weeks when a scan will be done to image the cancer itself.\nAs to what the next steps will be following this round of chemo – that is simply unknown."

We were excited to receive update pictures from Joel and Joanna C. as they travelled from Prince George with Sam’s good friends Chase and Ben C. Ben of course brought greetings from his family and Sam and I are now set up with our favourite cookies from Krista. We had an initial visit Saturday evening and despite a having to cancel a morning visit on Sunday the boys had great visits again in the afternoon.\nAn expected side effect from the chemotherapy was a drop in Sam’s blood counts. We saw this over the weekend with a full collapse of Sam’s white count on Sunday. This temporary loss of the body’s ability to fight was also paired with a fever and phlegm. The medical team was ready for this and had Sam on antibiotics right away. Visits were cancelled for most of the day as Tina and I watched our boy sleep most of the day away. By later afternoon, Sam was awake and was welcomed visits from Chase and Ben – though masks were needed for all. So good to see these boy / young men back together again – Good for the soul (ours and Sam’s)!"

I expect that Sam’s mouth will be more sensitive as sores develop, these sores could extend all they way through his digestive track. Chemo-balding is also expected.\nPotential for secondary infection: One of the effects of the chemotherapy is a reduction in Sam’s blood counts. The medical team can manage reductions in red cells and platelets, but they cannot manage reduced white cell counts. As such, Sam will be more susceptible to colds, flus, or whatever is floating around. We will likely move to a mask-up and wash-up protocol before entering the room.\nUltimately, that this intense treatment is effective at removing the cancer from Sam’s body."

The new central line working as expected, this line (aka Hickman device) was established travelling from Sam’s leg through to the major vessels just below his heart. The previous PICC lines were not able to reach the major vessels near the heart as there was too much clotting in Sam’s chest. With this new line established round two of chemotherapy has begun.\nChemotherapy medications were started promptly after Sam returned from surgery and a short period in recovery. All of these medications are entering his system through the central line system along with a lot of additional fluid. As I have noted in previous posts the drugs are intense and in order to protect his other organs additional fluid is needed. Practically speaking this means that life, and sleep are interrupted with many bathroom breaks.\nGram and Papa were here providing moral and practical support. We also had a visit from Lisa S. who brought a stack of cards from home with messages of encouragement from Sam’s friends at the Westwood Church’s youth group, along with cards for Tina and I."

Sam’s doctors who are excellent communicators and are gracious in allowing time for dialogue and answering our questions when they have answers, and are straight with us when they do not know.\nThere are a lot of unknowns going forward. Sam’s form of cancer is mostly unknown. As such, the treatment plan / chemotherapy will be to hit it with the largest hammer available. This will be hard on Sam’s body and we hope much harder on the cancer.\nIn preparation, another attempt to establish a central-line will be made. As the clotting in the chest blocking access via the arms towards the heart a line will be attempted through the vessels in one of Sams’s legs, to approach the heart from below. Once this line is established chemotherapy will begin. Timing will be based on the next available time… this may be as late as Friday."

The bulk of the day\n\nTo start Sam did go under general anesthetic to adjust his PICC-line and complete a lumbar puncture. The PICC procedure did not go the way the medical team had hoped. The plan was simply to adjust the position of the existing line, but they were not able to do this so they pulled that line and attempted a new line on the other arm. This new line also did not go as planned, as they were not able to centrally locate the outlet. This is where there is some concern, attempts to (re)position the previous or locate the current line failed due to blood clots in Sam’s system. No one is very clear as to why he has clots so frequently in his blood vessels (to be clear this is not because they are keeping anything from us … it is just they do not know). We know that some of the clots are an effect of the cancer – as the body tried to fight it; alternately, this clotting could be somehow related to the previous chemotherapy. The fact is there is clotting in Sam’s blood vessels, and there is more clotting than a couple weeks ago despite taking blood thinners twice a day.\nThe lumbar puncture went as planned.\nThe quiet afternoon turned into an additional procedure. The previous scans had focused on the upper chest and neck. This ultrasound was done to evaluate the potential of clotting in the abdomen and legs. Results are pending.\n\nWe were finally back to the room by about 4pm. Time for dinner. I had left overs. A friend had brought poke bowls yesterday and the left over one as almost as good as the first. Sam had a hospital dinner supplemented with snacks from Safeway. Tina was off on her own adventure.\nI am so happy for Tina as she was able to get away yesterday afternoon. Senga was here and she took her out to a local park and then out for a Tina-friendly meal."

    "text": "Clarifying, from what I understand\nIt really has been encouraging to see Sam come back, the return of his humor, his appetite, desires to do things. This morning, I want to explain my understanding of what has been happening with him. Before arriving, Sam was very sick, having extreme lethargy, and barely able to get out of bed. His body’s immune system was on overdrive in effort to battle what we now know is the cancer. The effect of this was that his whole body inflamed – think of a time that you had a small cut or burn and your skin was red and a little puffy around the injury… now take that idea and apply it to inside Sam’s body, and the majority of the lymphatic system. So why is he so much better now? Why does the treatment seem to be working so well? Is Sam healing?\nTreatment started this past Friday, six days ago, and by the end of Saturday Sam was already feeling much better. This is actually an expected response. I am unclear if how dramatic the response is was expected, but the medical team did expect a fairly rapid response. One of the drugs that is part of Sam chemotherapy prednisone, which can be used to change the way the body ’s immune system reacts – effectively taking the immune system out of overdrive and reducing all that internal swelling.\nSo is Sam getting better? Sam is definitely feeling better and has a much improved quality of life, and I hope and pray that he is getting better in the long term. However, I need to be clear, when it comes to the cancer in his body, we just do not know.\nSam is now scheduled for a scan tomorrow morning. We will know more once those results are in."

The medical team is also happy about this latest development.\nActivity levels are also coming up. Sam is able to walk around some more. He was able to walk the hall here and he spent an hour sitting up and talking with his Uncle Cal.\nThese recent changes certainly give us hope for the future and definitely joy in the here-and-now. We are grateful for all of this. We have been cautioned that these improvements can be expected, but that the only way to evaluate if the cancer is responding is to complete new scans to see what has happened to the tumors. We will continue to choose hope and take joy in each victory.\nGoing forward, the next days ahead should be routine with medicines, bloodwork, checking vitals, and a new addition of prescribed physiotherapy.

This is something that is essential for now, though not sustainable… we are stressed and exhausted.\n\nMy parents, Earle and Dorothy, are here with us. Great to have their support. Thanks to the many who are also supporting them.\nRecent scans confirm where the cancer is. No new surprises, though the impact of the cancer on Sam is stronger than previously known.\nCancer diagnosis is still pending. It is expected that BC Cancer Clinic will be able to identify the disease.\nHowever, we may not be able to wait. Initial treatment steps may need to be taken before the diagnosis is in. From the medical perspective this is about managing risk. Starting treatment without diagnosis may impact longer term effectiveness of the treatments; not starting could allow the cancer to impact Sam in the now."

    "text": "Reflections of April 23, 2023\nYesterday was a quiet day with challenges.\n\nCancer, but what type are we dealing with?\nYesterday morning, Tina and I spoke with Dr. Chang who has been taking the lead in Sam’s case. I was really glad to have this conversation, to know what Dr. Chang was thinking, and strategies going forward … but this one also hurt. The major challenge for the medical team is that they still do not know exactly what they are dealing with. This is a cancer, but the specific type of cancer remains unknown.\nGiven that there are unknowns around the type of cancer, there are also unknowns about how it will behave and potentially where it is. Sam needs to have a full-body scan, if an opening in the schedule at the BC Cancer Clinic can be found, and timing on this is essential. The scan needs to happen before treatment starts and the team can only wait so long (i.e. treatment needs to start this week).\n\n\nOn needles\nOver the last month, Sam has not had a good time with needles. Really, I think we can all relate – getting a shot, or having blood taken, is not something any of us enjoy. Sam has taken them on, with blood test after blood test. To make things worse, as Sam entered the hospital system he had to have IV medications, many of which failed. In the last nine IVs he experienced six failed attempts, and three were initially established successful; of those one was accidentally pulled during surgery, one blew, and a last one remains. All this to say needles cause a level of anxiety.\nSam has had a number of days of grace. The PICC line provides easy access, but last night it stopped working, they could not draw blood. If it does not work, then drawing blood via needles will be needed. In a few texts last night, we asked for prayer for this.\n\n\nVictories and comforts\n\nThe small things really do matter! Many thanks to our nurse Pam who made sure that Sam was able to get into the shower today. He came out clean, refreshed, and feeling human!\nI didn’t finish the needle story:\n\nThe doctor changes the order regarding taking blood. So no need for blood last night!\nThis morning I came into the room at 4:45 and both Sam and Tina were full of joy. Sam had just had his blood taken, and no needles were used. The PICC line was working again.\n\nSo where was I coming in from at 5:00am? We now have a home away from home at the Ronald McDonald House, where I had a comfortable, and mostly full night’s sleep.\n\n\n\nNeeds and concerns\nCurrently:\n\nFirm diagnosis of the type of cancer. This will significantly inform treatment.\nPET scan to determine where this disease is and where it is not. Timing is essential on this – the sooner the better.\nThat Sam’s PICC line would continue to function. Ideally, that it could also be used for treatment … either adjustments are needed or another PICC will need to be established as the current one is not ‘centrally located’ (not exactly where they need it to be)."

    "text": "TLDR\nWe are in a waiting period, and as results from Sam’s biopsies trickle in, we have some knowledge of what the disease is not. Our hearts are peaceful and we have been filled with messages of love and prayer from around the world!\n\n\nReflections on April 21, 2023\nHow long have we been here? As I write this, it is only the beginning of day four and I am writing about day 3, so much has happened.\nYesterday, was … a beautiful day. Sam was far more comfortable, being another day away from his biopsy surgery. It was wonderful to watch him sleep and nap on and off through the day. This time of rest also powered him up to visit with family. It was also great to see Tina catch up on some much-needed sleep.\n\nPhysical Health\nMedically, it was generally a quiet day. No new tests, just the routine of checking vitals, checking blood chemistry, and taking medicines (e.g. pain management from the previous surgery). We are in waiting phase. The lab has not finished processing the tissue samples taken April 20th. Despite not knowing much yet the medical team continues to communicate. The best news was that we now know that the disease is:\n\nnot in the central nervous system\nnot in his bone marrow.\n\nIt might be a quiet weekend as lab results may not come back until mid-next week. So we wait as a family, and the medical team waits with us. One might think this is frustrating, but it is not, rather it is a peaceful and strategic waiting. Once the tests come back the doctors will be very intentional on how to manage Sam’s health. So we wait, for the right understanding, and the subsequent right treatment plan.\n\n\nSoul Health\nWow, what a good day! We have heard from so many friends, family, some of whom we have not connected with for years, but this challenging time is pulling our people together. Thank you for reaching out to us, conveying your care, telling us your stories, or simply what is happening in your world. We are supported by your words, your love, and your prayers.\nPeople around the world are praying – it’s awesome. Friends, family, and their friends and families, bible study and prayer groups; from Prince George, across the province, across the continent, and as far away as Zambia!\nWe have also had some amazing face-to-face visits/care.\n\nA friend anticipated our needs and showed up with a bag of groceries and goodies picked especially for Tina and her dietary needs / requirements.\nA providential visit with the Schellenbergs with whom we have shared so much life and adventure. What are the chances that they just happened to be in the area this weekend! For those who don’t know them, they live in Saskatchewan.\nSam had a great visit with his cousin Chris, Uncle Cal, and Auntie Tricia.\n\nTo wrap up this post, please know that we feel cared for in soul and body. Although we do not know what treatment for Sam will look like, we are in a peaceful place. That might change, we may have challenges ahead, but we are bolstered by your love, we are carried.\nLove to you all!\nColin"

Steps are being taken to manage what all indications suggest is lymphoma. Staff here have been amazing in: providing care, communicating what is happening and next steps, and conveying a sense that ‘this is serious’ mixed with a calming confidence.\nThe process: Yesterday, tests were run – the primary one being a CT scan of his chest. Today, Sam will start the day with a surgery to complete a series of biopsies, the primary one being one of his lymph nodes at the base of his neck. By the end of the day, we should have firmer answers as to what exactly is happening and a treatment plan.\nSam’s friends and classmates have been amazing. They have been in direct communication with him via Snapchat and hearing from them has been really encouraging to him, also to Tina and I – it is amazing to see friends rally behind him.\nThank you for your support and prayers,\nColin and Tina"

    "text": "An anxious weekend\nLast Friday was filled with numerous appointments the most important being a PET scan to determine the current extent of Sam’s cancer. However, it is a rare day that we get the results on the same day – so we had to wait-out this past long/holiday weekend before getting the results.\nIn addition, given that Sam has been on morphine for such a long time, on Saturday we attempted a plan (suggested by our doctors) to switch him over to methadone (i.e. start replacing morphine with methadone). I do not fully understand why it did not work but by mid-day-Saturday Sam was writhing in pain. It would take another 36 hours before he would start feeling himself again. During this time we were able be with with Nana and the Fricker family (Saturday and Sunday). We would have loved for Sam to take part more with the family but the medication switch had taken him down – he was able to see everyone but he had very limited capacity to be with the family.\nBy Monday Sam was feeling better, having returned to his regular drug regime. Mid-day we had a nice visit/lunch with friends, Donna and Ciaro, whom we had met through RMH. In the evening we saw the Townsends. It was great to see Sam feeling better and he was even able to enjoy a game with his cousins. We were back at the RMH for the night as we had clinic the next morning."

    "text": "Scan results\nOnce again the cancer has grown but we are still fighting. Tina captured it really well in her text to some friends and family yesterday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTina’s text to friends and family (Sept. 3, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your love and prayers. I am sending a message I sent Shan recently (to avoid a lengthy rewrite) It is not necessarily edited and may feel raw?! But you need to have an update about what’s happening. We are still fighting so we praise God for this chance 🙌🙌🙌\nWe were in clinic until about 5:30pm then had dinner together …. The CT scan showed that the cancer has grown. Thankfully, however, it has not grown so much that our Dr won’t offer treatment. We had a long serious discussion with Dr Jacob about proceeding with more immunotherapy considering the potential (fatal) risks. It was actually an amazing discussion. Sam showed such courage and strength and honesty that Jacob (and our nurse clinician Julianna) were amazed and almost in tears. Sam said that he would rather die quickly trying to fight the cancer than giving up treatment and suffering slowly. Colin and I are also in agreement with this statement. So Sam will have immunotherapy again tomorrow morning (unless there is something really off with the bloodwork) with the understanding that we have to stay very close to the hospital and have frequent monitoring for the next while (week and a half?). We are also going to go up on one of Sam’s pills (trying to reach therapeutic levels of that medicine) (that in theory - only in controlled experiments - may be shown to help fight cancer). So it has been stressful and heavy again but Sam is courageous and we continue to go forward in faith together …. Also believing this continues to be the next reasonable thing to do. Sam continues to choose joy and wants to have an evening of the three of us just being together doing things. We really really value your prayers and presence with us on this journey. It is extremely important to us and we are so grateful for your love and care ❤️\n\n\n\n\nTreatment review\nIf you have been following Sam’s story you know that in the current chapter of immunotherapy (i.e. post-chemotherapy, post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug Nivolumab has been challenging:\n\nWhen it was first given at the end of February Sam’s liver became inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it again. During this period the cancer grew.\nSam restarted Nivolumab in June paired with another drug, Ruxolitinib, to control side effects. Sam’s body tolerated this well but dosing was likely below therapeutic levels. At the beginning of August scans demonstrated that the cancer had continued to grow.\nIn the first week of August Sam received a single dose of Nivolumab at what was believed to be a therapeutic level. However, by this time the cancer was having impacts on Sam’s heart. In the weeks following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein returning blood from much of Sam’s upper body to his heart. The second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect. Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these surgeries – his body needed time to heal.\nYesterday’s scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August, had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with treatment – understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam."

However, in doing so we recognize that this may also cause side effects that we have been hoping to avoid. He will remain in hospital for monitoring overnight and if he remains stable he may be discharged to the RMH over the weekend.\nNext week Sam will have another contrast-CT in an attempt to image if any impacts can be measured.\nSo how are we doing through all of this you ask? It would be a lie to say we are not scared. The disease has been a constant threat and now more than ever. However, there are great moments of joy. It is impossible not to smile when Sam wakes from a nap with a big smile on his face saying “I’m so happy.” He is happy – he knows he is cared for and he knows that he is loved."

Sometimes the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this journey.\nSam’s heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around his heart – a pericardial effusion. We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made it through again!\nWe are celebrating the success of Sam’s stent surgery (see here). The outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)\nTo date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.\nIt was amazing to see Sam join the Ness Lake Bible Camp team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked, played – he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.\nWe are thankful to the medical team here at BC Childrens’ Hospital who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.\nWe are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the hospital. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nThankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all through this journey.\nWe long for the day when Sam is free of this disease."

    "text": "BMT Plan\nBMT: Bone Marrow Transplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nI feel I need a quick disclaimer here as I am not sure I have all of this right. In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there … dates and details are likely to change.\n\n\n\nOverview\nThis is the plan as I understand it:\n\nSam has completed the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.\nIn preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam’s health going into BMT.\nBone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is expected to be Nov. 14 .\nFollowing the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0. Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.\n\nDays -22 to -11 (~Oct. 23): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.\nDay -6 and -4: Full body radiation to ensure Sam’s own immune system is completely removed – in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system.\nDays -3 to -1: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam’s own immune system.\nDay zero, currently planned for Nov. 14, Sam should receive the transplant. This is actually quite simple – like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam’s body via his central line.\nDays 0 to 30 Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.\nDays 31 through 90: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Objectives\n\n\nChallenges ahead\nBelow is copied from our Oct. 20st post\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 1: Targeted radiation\n\nThe objective here is to directly attack the cancer and destroy as much as possible. There are both immediate and long term challenges. The radiation oncologist is trying to balance attacking the cancer while protecting the adjacent lungs which are very sensitive to radiation damage. In the short term there will be fatigue and pain – think of a time that you had a bad sun burn. Now take that sunburn and put it on the inside of your body. Sam may feel it most in his throat.\n\nRadiation therapy – phase 2: Total body irradiation (TBI)\n\nNext, Sam will undergo three days of total body radiation (TBI). This radiation will not target his cancer, rather it is undertaken to condition his body for the upcoming bone marrow transplant. TBI has the objective of permanently destroying Sam’s native immune system so that his immune system will not compete with the transplant.\n\n\nThere is a long list of potential side effects from the two radiation treatments. A few of these include: permanent scarring of the lungs, impacts on the thyroid, heart disease, changes to metabolism, secondary cancers, and others. Needless to say this can be scary.\n\n\nThis step, in conjunction with the following BMT Chemotherapy, mark a point of no return. Once these steps are initiated a transplant must happen for Sam to ever have an immune system again.\n\nBMT Chemotherapy\n\nThe previous chemotherapy that Sam has had focused on targeting and removing the disease. This upcoming chemotherapy has a different objective. In conjunction with TBI it will be used to remove Sam’s own immune system. Following this chemotherapy any cells that produce/create blood will have been killed, and Sam’s bone marrow will be ready to receive the transplant. As with most chemotherapy drugs this treatment will likely make Sam feel ill.\n\nThe transplant/graft\n\nOn Nov. 14th Sam is scheduled to receive the donated bone marrow. The donated cells will need to establish or engraft to start providing Sam his new immune system. In the 2-3 weeks following receiving the transplant we will wait in anticipation for signs that the graft is taking hold. The whole transplant process will take place in an isolation room – Sam will not be allowed to leave until his new immune system takes hold. Tina and I will be able to gown-up and be with him.\n\n\nThis will be a hard number of weeks. Given the prior steps Sam will likely feel horrible for numerous weeks. It is highly likely that he will need significant intravenous supports for management of pain, nausea, engraftment of the new immune system, hydration, nutrition, and then potentially additional medication should he become ill without an immune system to support him. To provide all of these supports Sam may need upward of 15 different intravenous lines to all be connected at once. His current central lines should support most of this.\n\n\nOnce the graft takes hold it will start generating Sam’s new immune system and start fighting for him, including battling the cancer. However, this is a foreign immune system and steps will need to be taken ensure that the graft does not attack Sam – potential graft versus host disease. The graft also must remain aggressive enough to continually attach the cancer."

Materials here are soon to be updated with next phase of plans.\n\nBMT transplant date: Nov 9 Nov 14\nUpdates to the countdown dates.\nFollowing round four, Sam had a PET scan to determine how his cancer was progressing. Results indicated that we continue to move in the right direction. The cancer was reduced in size and remained in known locations – that is it had not spread anywhere else. However, it was also apparent that the rate of reduction was not enough to remove the cancer by the end of this chemotherapy regime.\nRound six of Sam’s initial chemotherapy treatment is now complete. The PET scan results support the current plan to provide a bone marrow transplant. As the BMT date approaches Sam will have a number of tests to determine his baseline health before starting his bone-marrow-transplant protocol."

    "text": "TLDR (short version)\nYesterday: surgery for tissue samples followed by pain management. In the weeks to come, Sam will be here at BC Children Hospital as he is treated for what is assumed to be lymphoma.\n--\n\n\nFull version\nHi all,\nYesterday was a big day for Sam. He had the surgery to complete a series of biopsies. These included the removal of a lymph node at the base of his neck, a lumbar puncture, a bone marrow sample from the top of his hip, and establishing a PICC (described here) to facilitate ongoing blood work and upcoming intravenous drug delivery. All the procedures went well. Dr. Webber, completed the lymph node removal and said it went “Perfectly”. This was all done before noon. The biggest challenge of the day has been pain management, but Sam has been a trooper.\nThe staff here continue to be amazing, always taking the time to answer any of Sam’s questions, and making complex biology and bio-chemistry understandable. It is honestly amazing to hear Sam explain his disease to others – he gets it, understands it, and given the situation is very glad to be here.\nNext steps are not totally clear. We are working with the understanding/assumption that Sam has lymphoma (one possibility described here) As of April 23, we still do not know what type of cancer this is. The signs all point that way (e.g. X-ray and CT scan), but this will not be totally confirmed until the tissue samples are processed. Here is what we are currently expecting:\n\nSam will start a round of drug treatment, as soon as later today, and specific treatments will be refined following the analysis of his tissue samples\nSam is currently in the ICU, and we expect him to be here for the next number of days after which, he will be transferred to the oncology unit just a few floors above where he will remain a patient for three weeks or so (timing of stay will all depend on tests).\nTina and I will be able to check into the Ronald McDonald House here on hospital campus on Sunday. This will give us a home base, we will also be able to continue staying in the room with Sam.\n\nMany thanks to all of Sam’s friends and teachers, and all of our friends and family. We love to hear from you. We may not get back to you right away but know your messages are encouraging to us. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will try to answer them either directly or in a following update.\n\n\nQ&A\n\nHow is Tina doing?\n\nShe is actually great. She has been working so hard advocating for Sam’s health over the last months, trying to get the bottom of why he has been sick. Now, she can relax as Sam is where he needs to be, receiving the medical care that he needs. She also loves the medical world, she is in her element here. Our biggest challenge for Tina will be to ensure she is properly fed, especially given her dietary restrictions. We will need to find a new normal here.\n\nHow can we help / Let us know if we can help.\n\nHearing from you is currently the best. As noted, we might not be able to get back to you right away, but all of your notes are encouraging. Tina and I have literally had tears-of-joy reading them.\n\n\nThanks again for your prayers and support,\nColin and Tina"

Over this last week I have watch with joy and contentment as Sam slept peacefully, to another extreme filled with waves of fear and anxiety that he hasn’t woken up (yesterday). In the later afternoon yesterday, we stepped away from Sam’s bedside, where he continued to sleep, to visit with Cal and Tricia. My day was made when we got back, he was not only awake, but he was up and out of bed, sitting in a chair. This was sweet joy, relief, and peace.

You are our friends and family. This is the truth of where we are at.\n\nTina and I have wept, we have wailed. It comes in waves – releases of love, pain, and grief from a depth of my being that I never before knew existed. The reality is, we might lose our boy.\nSam is sick, he has cancer, treatment has not begun and he continues to get sicker.\nWe do not know what kind of cancer this is. Cancer in children is rare, and Sam’s cancer, is extremely rare – the disease specialists have not been able to identify it.\nWe do not know if this cancer is treatable. It is so unknown; treatment might be simple… but it also may not be possible. We just do not know.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent and next steps\n\nSam had is PET scan yesterday – we do not know the results.\nSam received a feeding tube. His nausea had been debilitating, and he has eaten very little in the last weeks.\nWe continue to wait for a treatment plan.\n\n\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nPray.\nContinue to send us your care. We are bolstered by your notes of encouragement, love, and support.\nWe have been blessed with visits from friends and family.\nIf you would like to see us, please contact me first, and I will try to work something out. Please be aware that as we move forward, ideally into treatment, visits with Sam may be highly restricted."

I managed to get some sleep over at the Ronald McDonald House and came back to Sam’s room for 5:00 (these days that is sleeping in for me). Shortly after I got here Sam woke up. Despite the intensity of the previous day, despite the pains in his body, he was full of faith and joy. He celebrated that his PICC worked for the latest blood-work (currently running at every four hours). We chatted for a bit, I rubbed his back, wrapped him in a warm blanket, and then tucked him back in. Currently he is sleeping soundly."

    "text": "Reflections on April 28\nThis date will be significant to use for the rest of our lives – that day we received a diagnosis and the initiation of treatment.\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nIn the morning the lead care team (Oncologist, Clinical Care Nurse, and Social Worker) met with us – the three of us to start, and then Tina and I for the details. Finally we have a diagnosis, Sam’s cancer has been identified. We have been looking forward to this as a diagnosis leads to a plan … if you know what it is, you can know how to treat it. We all wish it was that simple.\nSam has an extremely rare form of cancer. It is a blood-based cancer mostly located in the lymphatic system. The name of the disease is almost as long as the first two sentences in this paragraph. We know what to call it, we know where it is, the team will treat it. However, the treatment plan will be week-to-week, and as treatment phases are completed, additional steps will be taken to evaluate the response/impact on the disease.\nPhase 1 of treatment has started, a round of chemotherapy, and we know the plan for this week.\nI have to add that Sam is a champ! Today’s needle count tallied to 4 including the addition a new IV line.\n\n\nSurrounded by love\n\nMy Mom and Dad were here and were have to have a good time talking with Sam while Tina and I met with the medical team. I am glad they were here. It was good to share tears with them.\nRhoda and Dave, had a great conversation with Sam, and gifted him with comics and games\nTina had a great call with sister.\nMany thanks to all of you for your notes of support, well-wishes, and prayers! Your words, stories, encouragement, and solidarity with us are amazing.\n\n\n\nNeeds, concerns and victories\n\nWe are all walking in the dark. Our family and the Drs. Pray for wisdom to simply see the next step.\nWe need to see the cancer respond to the treatment. It is unknown, how this cancer will respond, or how it may adapt/ resist.\nChemotherapy, is intense, and some of the chemicals are literally poison. We have entered a world of trade-offs. The disease must die, but the treatment has dangers and significant potential side-effects.\n\nWe will count the small victories and joys\n\nSam took on numerous pokes/needles like a champ.\nSam’s PICC worked … most of the time.\nOut of bed. Sam’ has been sick and mostly bed-ridden. He enjoyed some time out of bed sitting up in a chair.\nIt was a puppy therapy day today. If you know Sam you know he loves dogs.\n\n\n\nMeditation\nThere are two passages of scripture that are constantly in my mind. Two passages that reflect in-part where I am at.\n\nHe guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; Psalm 23\n\n\nif you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” “ ‘If you can’?”said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” Mark 9:14f"

We got out of the room, taking a tour of the ward, and checking out the youth room where we discovered options for art, music, a library of games (digital and board), movies, and video games. We made plans to start a Harry Potter movie marathon.\nSam was hungry again and I biked down to Broadway to grab a pizza (a great outing for me). It is weird, but life felt … normal. Our normal, now includes regular check-ins with nurses and doctors who are doing their routines of checking vitals, taking blood, loading Sam’s supplemental feeding, adjusting oxygen… this is normal? this is routine? Yes, it seems to be… and it was all going well until it wasn’t.\nIt is amazing how one tiny little thing can mess up your routine Something jammed up Sam’s NG-tube1. Attempts to clear it resulted in spillage and literally hours of frustration and extra work by the nurses. Sam has been patient through most all of it, and lost some significant time for sleeping… it is still not cleared."

Even though the little things may be issues in a larger storm they have a strong influence on life. I am thankful for the little-graces. I am learning to not take them for granted. I also hope for little graces in this journey ahead.\nWe are thankful for the medical team for all their hard work and care.\nWe also cannot forget the larger issue. We are in a major storm of life. Sam has cancer. His prognosis is unknown. We choose hope, but that does not mean waves of fear to not threaten to swamp us. We hope and pray for his healing. That the cancer would respond to treatment. That we would be able to go home together."

I got out for a couple hours to do some shopping to gear us up to live here. A carry-on bag of cloths was just not enough and we all needed some new socks. Tomorrow I will get out to stock up on snacks – as our boy’s appetite continues to strengthen. In the evening, the three of us got out onto a deck and watched the sunset."

We have an idea of what the next five days may hold. The medical team does not know what the steps are beyond as they do not have the data. Although it would be nice to know what Sam is in for, what challenges he may have to face, I appreciate that decisions are being made based on the information available. When more is known, informed decisions can be made."

Sam definitely has his humor back stating to the doctor that we will set your mind at ease by looking at my mind.\nAs a family we had a relaxing evening.

    "text": "Reflections on May 16 and 17\nYesterday morning, as I was considering what to convey, the day started with a challenge… I will get to that, but before I do I actually need to back up two days.\nTwo days ago we had a meeting with our medical team. It was a fairly standard check-in but one that shook Tina and I to the core. We were both, individually, in own personal funks for much of the day before we had an opportunity to discuss it together. During the meeting we were introduced to members of the medical team from Canuck Place. They let us know some of the services that they provide including potential future options respite from the hospital experience. What shook us to the core was the main purpose of Canuck Place – palliative care. To be clear, we are not going down that road, but not knowing what the future holds, it is within the realm of possibility and I suspect that the medical team here had a ethical obligation to ensure this connection was made. We have known this, but the meeting forced us to confront the possibility more directly – again, re-opening this wound/fear.\nTwo days ago was also the fifth of five days of the heavy chemical delivery for this current round of chemotherapy. The remaining 16 days of this chemo round are in place for the chemicals to complete their work, and to allow Sam to recover from it. As of that evening we had not seen much for side effects. Yesterday morning, that would change.\nYesterday, as I was considering what to write, Sam’s day began with a strong wave of nausea and pain. The previous two nights one of the drugs that Sam was given was Cytarabine. I’ll blame that one, though it could been side effects from the whole set. It took several hours to get Sam comfortable, and by the afternoon he was feeling ok, tired but ok. And, though I am exhausted as well, Sam’s fatigue is beyond the lack of sleep we have been having as is a product of the treatment the chemo. In addition the chemotherapy medications will reduce Sam’s blood counts – reducing the capacity of his blood to: provide him energy/oxygen (hemoglobin/ red blood cells), protect him from injury (platelets), and protect him from disease (white blood cells).\nSome positive highlights:\n\nTina and Erin S. were able to spend some time together (2 days ago)\nA relaxed and enjoyable visit with Uncle Cal and cousin Jane (yesterday)\nCoffee and treats sent to by friends."

The heavy chemical part of the treatment is over and now Sam’s body has to work through the effects. Effects include (these are generally expected):\n\ncollapse of the immune system: Sam’s blood counts are monitored daily. Over the last number of days drops in the red and platelet cells have been managed with transfusions. We need to simply wait for the white cells to come back. It seems Sam may be through the worst of this part as cell counts are beginning to return on their own.\nsores in the GI system. Sam had some sores in his mouth earlier in this process. They have healed but he has other much further on in the system that are painful. These will heal in time.\nMost of Sam’s time is spent in bed … his body is doing a lot of work. The downside of being in bed this long is that he is stiff and sore; he has a lot of muscle tension and very little energy to stretch it out or move to loosen it up. We will get there but there is work to be done.\n\n\nNext steps and current state of the cancer:\n\nThe truth is the next steps are very much unknown. The treatment plan will depend on how the cancer has responded to this latest round of therapy.\nWe are encouraged, Sam had an X-ray to rule out that the flu he had was not causing a pneumonia. This scan confirmed that he did not have pneumonia. What was unexpected, is that the scan also gave us a glimpse at the state of his cancer, and the doctors confirmed that the cancer-mass has shrunk.\nOnce this current therapy is complete on June 2nd Sam will be booked for a scan. Once the results of the scan are known a new plan will be made."

In consultation with the medical team most all of Sam’s meds moved from a) being on a delivery schedule to list as take-as-needed, b) changed from IV delivery to oral. The purpose of this day was to prepare us to get out – to give us control of Sam’s care.\nJune 2, yesterday, was very full with procedures and our transition out of the hospital. Forty-five days prior we made the emergency move from Prince George to the hospital. We have lived there full time and now we had the day to prepare to leave.\n\nThe day started with trip to the BC Cancer Clinic for a PET and CT scan. This was much easier than the last trip. Last time the Ambulance service transported Sam which was needed given the state of his health at that time. This time, the three of us went downstairs, got in a taxi, and walked into the clinic.\nNext were the steps to leave including:\nA trip to the pharmacy – to collect all of Sam’s medications. This was actually simple, as the pharmacy is just downstairs. I would realize hours later, well after closing that I bought the wrong needles for Sam’s blood thinner…\nTrips to move our lives over to the RMH1. In our time here we have lived full-time at the hospital with minor respite at the RMD. During our time here we have only added materials to our lives as we bought or people brought us life-essentials, and gifts arrived. We are blessed to have all that we need and more. I did spend a couple hours moving our things – very glad that the RMD had utility wagon that we could borrow.\nTrip to the Red Cross – to get some hardware for Sam. He has some strength to regain so in moments of weakness or fatigue he can fall back to the wheelchair or shower-transfer-bench.\n\nWe were fully here by 7:00pm. We are loving it! The feelings this morning are almost reminiscent of family vacations that we have had in the past. We are not home but we are free to be ourselves!"

In the afternoon Sam would receive his first chemical doses of chemo round 21.\n\nResults\nWe had an opportunity to look at before and after imagery from Sam’s PET scans. I am glad I had not seen the first scans until now. The difference is dramatic.\n\nThe size and density to the cancerous mass is greatly reduced\nThe impacts on Sam’s other organs has been removed – or is minimal. The first scans showed high impacts on Sam’s lungs heart – mostly causing high levels of fluid build up and pressure. Now his lungs are now clear of fluid and only a residual amount of fluid remains around the heart – this is expected to resolve over time. 3. Currently Sam has two main masses of cancer. The main one in his chest and a smaller one in his neck. They are greatly reduced since our arrival seven weeks ago. I need to get a copy of the results again so I can quantify the amount of reduction.\n\nThis is exciting – the cancer is responding to treatment.\n\n\nPlans\nIt is exciting to see such progress. In moments of weakness it is also terrifying. The remains a lot of work to be done these cancerous masses are measurable in centimetres – there are billions of cancerous cells to be removed2.\nDespite the challenges, for the first time we actually have a plan! Until now, none of us have known what the plan would be. Sam’s cancer is extremely rare, and how it would respond to treatment was not known. Now that we know the treatment is working. We will move forward with a treatment regime. The plan is to complete six rounds of chemotherapy with on-going evaluation to adapt the plan as needed."

No longer is everyday a new experience, or sitting in expectation of some procedure. The pace has slowed and life has become somewhat more predictable.\nSam is currently on day 8 of his second round of chemotherapy. The medical team really wants to maximize his time away from the hospital so, given that he was doing well having received all the medications on Saturday morning, they discharged him for the weekend! The plan is that he goes back into the hospital before his blood counts drop too low and his immune system becomes compromised.\nThis morning we will go to the hospital to get his blood levels tested and either be admitted for be sent back out for 48 hours."

We had a great brunch and visit with them!\n\nMonday, June 12\n\nSimilar to Sunday, we had another slow day. Margaret and Daniel spent some good time with us simply hanging out at the RMH. The five of us also managed a short outing to grab ice at the Dairy Queen on Main St. Sam is also getting to know another young man here. J. was diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks after Sam – I expect we will be connecting with him and his family over the weeks ahead."

Today is also marks 7 days of not being in the hospital!\nDr. Cheng has told us a number of times that we need to remain flexible on this journey as each round of chemo is different. There are different sets of chemotherapy drugs in each round. With each round Sam is also different. Starting this round Sam has had a amazing return of his health as compared with the first. A few points to compare:\nI thank God. I thank all of you for your care. I thank the medical team for all their great work."

Sam and I started playing crib again.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, Cal T. paid us a visit. We had a great talks and Sam had a new challenger for crib. Yes, Sam beat both Cal and I.\n\nFriday, June 16\n\nWe had an appointment at the oncology-day-clinic. Checked Sam’s blood levels, cleaning and dressing changes for Sam’s central-line. The lab is fast – blood levels were back levels are dropping, but again they are still above any levels of concern.\n\n\nI clarified with the doctor, wondering if it was possible to skip the valley caused by chemotherapy. As I understand it:\n\nThe valley will come. Sam’s immune system will collapse to zero (as indicated by the ANC1 metric). … Yes, I have created a graph for this.\nBe flexible, each round of chemo is different. Some rounds the valley is short. Some the valley is long. Be flexible, as it is not possible to know.\n\nIn the afternoon, we had a great visits Chris and Jane, and David C. We all took Dave to the airport, and based on Hunter’s recommendation from over a month ago we shared a meal at the Fairmont – delicious!\nThe evening was a shock. Tina and I were not ready for this. Sam, energized by a great meal was not done. As many of you know, Tina often starts to come alive as the sun gets low. So we were off to the [Richmond Night Market](https://richmondnightmarket.com). We spent over two hours exploring the booths. Sam loved it! Tina loved it!\nWe are all stunned by how well Sam is doing!"

This morning marks day 19 of this round of chemotherapy – Sam has made it through the chemo-valley without the need of hospital time (his numbers are starting to recover). What a difference!\nIt is really weird as it seems we stumbled our way into this out-patient status. With the exception of four nights, when Sam received the chemo-chemicals, he has been out of the hospital for this round. Sam has had clinic appointments twice a week, and at each one we half-expected that he may need to be admitted. We know now that, even with dropping blood levels, if Sam keeps feeling good there was no need to return to the hospital. Living on the hospital campus makes out-patient life feasible as in the event Sam got sick (e.g. due to his chemo-compromised immune) we would simply visit the ER here and follow the oncology patient protocols."

Sam’s cancer is unknown and as such it is impossible to know if the current treatment will be fully effective. If it is not, then what next? We discussed the possibility of following the current treatment up with a bone marrow transplant. There is quite a lot of planning needed to move forward with a such a procedure as a donor needs to be found. So we are starting now.\nThe bone marrow transplant treatment, if needed, would start following the current treatment (~early Oct), and would add some significant time to our stay down here.\nIf it is needed, of course we will do it.

Sam was having chest pain and headaches that would come in waves. The medical team pursued the potential for a blood embolus (throwing a clot) ordering ECGs, bloodwork, and a CT.

In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there … dates and details are likely to change.\n\n\nDuring last week’s clinic visits we gained some more clarity on the planned treatment for Sam.\n\nSam will complete the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.\nThere had been some discussion about skipping the 6th round and going straight to bone-marrow-transplant (BMT) but there was just too many moving parts. The team needed more time to line everything up. This means we have about six weeks remaining in this treatment regime before pivoting to BMT.\nIn preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam’s health going into BMT.\nBone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is estimated to be Nov. 2 .\nFollowing the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0. Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.\n\nDays -12 to -8 (~Oct. 16): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.\nDays -7 to -2: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam’s own immune system.\nDay -1: General full body radiation to ensure Sam’s own immune system is completely removed – in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system.\nDay zero, currently planned for Nov. 2, Sam should receive the transplant. This is actually quite simple – like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam’s body via his central line.\nDays 0 to 30 Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.\n\nDays 31 through 90: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins."

Top of my mind:\n\nWe are here and we have access to an incredible medical team and facility.\nWe are able to walk this journey as a family. Support from work, family and friends, church, and the local community allows us to be here without having to worry about life and responsibilities back home. Thank you!\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides us a home away from home.\nSam has been able to connect with friends – especially in the last couple weeks. They talked or talked while playing online games.\nVisitors: We have family in the area that come by on a regular basis to support us. We have friends that make extra efforts to some and see us.\n\n\nHighlights from this past week\n\nBaseline tests and clinic days\n\nAs we begin to wrap up round 6 and pivot to bone-marrow transplant there are many medical appointments. This week was full with regular clinic visits plus the addition of baseline tests.\n\nThursday Nana and Kevin visit\n\nKevin and I got away – we roamed around downtown and grabbed dinner. It was great to away from the hospital campus for a few hours.\n\n\nNana visited with Sam and Tina at the Ronald McDonald House. Following the loss of Gord, Mary has moved south where she is surrounded by family and can access Sam. She in a suite attached to Kevin and Shannon’s.\n\nFriday’s fever\n\nIt was a normal clinic visit on Friday morning. We had gone in expecting to review blood levels and then return to the RMH. However, Sam spiked a fever. In a normal non-cancer scenario any of us would just sleep it off, but Sam’s immune system is compromised. Antibiotics were started, tests and bacterial cultures were ordered, and plans were made to admit Sam to the ward for this past weekend. We are hoping/expecting to be discharged later today to return to the RMH.\n\n\nDave and Louise SP, friends of ours working in SE Asia were able to stop by before catching their flight back. Great to catch up with and be encouraged by them.\n\nSupercars Saturday\n\nOne of the other parents at the RMH was able to connect with a group of Supercar owners. We thought we might miss-out but the doctor here gave Sam an afternoon pass to take part. We were able to talk with the owners, look at, sit in, and got for some quick rides in these beautiful cars. Makes included Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and Mercedes. I think whenever I see one of these cars on the road I will always remember the joy on all the families faces and the hospitality of all the owners."

At that time it seemed evident that the cancer would not fully respond to the planned six rounds of chemotherapy. This is the result we have.\n\nThe last two rounds of chemotherapy have held the cancer. The mass is stable – it has not grown and it has not spread anywhere new. … Although the cancer has not had any significant decrease in size, the chemotherapy regime that Sam has been under has been effective at holding the cancer back long enough to prepare the BMT process. We also know that the BMT process is the next best step as the now completed chemotherapy was no longer effective at reducing the disease.\nThe result are what the medical team hoped and planned for. Plans were initiated over seven weeks ago to prepare for this outcome. If the cancer had grown or spread our conversations with the medical team could have been very different.\n\nThe results are good – as they support the plan.\nThe results are also challenging as a hard road lays ahead."

    "text": "This past week\n\nTreatment\nSam is currently in his targeted radiation phase, which is intended to directly attack the main mass of cancer in his body. Each day this past week we went to the BC Cancer clinic at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). During each visit the technician would use a mold of Sam to get him into position. The mold extends from below his shoulders up over his head and they use it to literally pin him to the treatment table ensuring that he is in the exact same position each time – thereby ensuring the radiation focuses on the intended area.\nSam is doing well with it all. Sam is now over thirty days away from the previous chemo-drug treatments and his strength is returning. He is a generally healthy young man, but with cancer. This is where we want him to be – as healthy and as strong as possible before starting the BMT.\nSo far the only side effect from the radiation therapy has been fatigue. It is different than chemo-fatigue which caused him to not have any energy, be nauseated, and caused brain fog. This radiation induced fatigue is the need to sleep, but once awake Sam usually has energy to go for walks and enjoy his life.\n\n\nVisitors\nWe had a good number of family and friends visiting with us this past week. Not everyone got to see Sam as he is being very cautious about seeing people – he is also training Tina and I to do the same as we all mask up more and more. Visitors included:\n\nGram and Papa spent some great time with Sam prior to heading home this past Monday\nNana, now living in the area, was able to come by for the Thursday afternoon.\nUncle Kevin and cousin Kaden were able to be here for a few hours. I love it when Sam and Kaden have a chance to hang out.\nFriday morning I had a great visit with Aaron W.\nFriday afternoon we spent some good time, Colin with Rob, and Tina with Leanne D. They also delivered some great messages of support from our church family in Prince George – thank you all!\nYesterday evening we were able to get away from the RMH and spend the evening with family out in Langley – celebrating our nieces birthdays. We are so fortunate to have family close by."

As a family we had a good time sharing the notes of encouragement that we have received from the recent post on Facebook.\nToday Sam completes the TBI treatments.\nI am writing from BC Children’s Hospital, it is in the morning of Day -5 leading up to Sam’s bone marrow transplant (BMT; transplant day is Nov. 14). Yesterday Sam began his BMT conditioning treatments. This started with two rounds of total body irradiation (TBI) at 8:00am and 2:30pm. Following these treatments Sam was admitted, as planned, to the hospital.\nThe days leading up to the BMT will be full of various treatments to prepare Sam’s body to receive the donated bone marrow. We had expected this to be hard, but I had not expected it to be immediately hard. This new treatment has hit Sam with a new intensity. He has been nauseous and ill, has had distinct new pains, and slept most of the day and continues to sleep now. Talking with the doctors all of the new symptoms are common to the TBI.\nSam continues to be strong. Halfway through the afternoon treatment he was nauseated, he took a few minutes to puke, then with a let’s-do-this-determination positioned himself to complete the second half of that treatment."

Over the weekend he will receive chemotherapy. The intent of these treatments will be permanently remove Sam’s native immune system. More specifically, the blood producing cells in his bone marrow will be destroyed to make room for the donated material. There will be no going back.\n\n\nImmune suppression\nAlso on the weekend Sam will start receiving immune suppression treatments to prepare his body to receive the transplant material. Where the TBI and chemotherapy remove the body’s ability to generate new blood including immune system blood cells, the immune suppression therapy will manage the existing immune defenses. Sam’s existing mature immune defense cells will be suppressed so that they do no attack the donated material – facilitating the acceptance of the donated bone marrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMid-day update\n\n\n\nIt has been half a day since I initially wrote this. This morning’s TBI therapy went much the same as yesterday’s. Since we have been back to the hospital the team here has made extra efforts to manage Sam’s symptoms.

It all goes as planned this will have been his last dose ever, and I look forward to a time when the memories of chemotherapy fade. Chemo sucks.\nYesterday was going really well for Sam. He woke up with a bright attitude and energy to take on the day. He really enjoyed his visit with his friends Chase and Caleb C. Ahh so good to see friends – what a bright highlight to our day! Following this visit Sam had a big nap.\nUnfortunately, Sam woke up shortly after shift change in piecing pain – the side effects of chemo had set in while he had slept. When he woke mucositis had had left his mouth as an open wound, raw and full of sores. I am sure as many of you know from your own experiences it is hard to watch your child in pain. It took some time to get new orders but solutions were found. We had to wait an abnormal amount of time for the pain specialist team… we had to wait because they were helping some other poor child with their pain.\nBetween 10pm and 1am we had some needed victories:\nA special thanks to our nursing team who advocated for Sam and took on all of the additional task needed to get Sam comfortable. Thank you especially to Ana and Molly."

Tina and I spent the night in the room and all things considered he is doing well.\nAt 5:06pm Nov. 14, 2023 Sam started to received his new bone-marrow stem cells. Two hours later the IV drip was complete and the donated cells had been received. As hoped receiving the donor cells was very uneventful. Sam had been pre-medicated with numerous drugs to facilitate receiving these foreign cells. A good number of those drugs also cause drowsiness – so Sam slept through most of the procedure. Although there were many hands ready to jump into action should something go wrong, nothing did! Sam’s vitals were and continue to remain within stable limits. Now we wait.\nSo far things have gone as well as we could hope but it is still not easy on Sam. His body aches. He often has nausea. Although he is hungry very little appetites him. The pain and anti-nausea meds help but not entirely. Sam has gone through a lot and the most recent steps have literally taken a lot out of him. With organ-transplants surgeons cut out the existing organ and incredibly put in the donated one. With a BMT, it is a mind-trip, but we had to kill a part of Sam to make way for the transplant material. With the way made and the new cells received, we now wait.\nIn this period of waiting a silent battle wages inside Sam’s body. Vitals (e.g. blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates) are monitored. Chemical metrics are monitored through regular bodily fluids (blood and urine). Over the next weeks the transplant material should establish. The team here has been excellent at passing on information as it come in so we will learn more as we go. Metrics indicating the successful engraftment/establishment of the stem cells are not expected for 2-3 weeks."

With every round of chemotherapy his blood counts would drop and his bones, more specifically the marrow, would work hard to generate and replace the blood cells killed by the treatment. The BMT process was this again, but more intense. This time the marrow was entirely cleared out. The transplant cells have taken up home in the marrow and are cranking out new blood – but not without pain.\nIt is very exciting that Sam’s body is now generating new blood. The challenge is that this blood is still foreign to him. The medial team keeps a close eye on Sam looking for signs of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) – where the new transplanted immune system could start attacking Sam. It is amazing, that cancer and immune therapy research has progressed so far that the team has a whole set of tools to address GVHD.\nTo date, and relatively speaking, Sam has not had much GVHD issues – though we will be watching for any complications in the weeks and months ahead. Sam has had painful, hot, and blotchy rashes show up – usually in the evening that may be attributed to GVHD. Although we throw everything we can at these flair-ups he often has to simply suffer through for an hour or two.\nSam continues to be courageous! He conveys gratefulness to everyone on the team and to Tina and I as we assist him through the days."

    "text": "Wow! It has been an amazing 48 hours!\nTuesday, two days ago, Santa visited a number of hospitals in the province and our family got to be a part of this celebration. Sam was able to be one of the first to welcome him to the ward and the staff loved his enthusiasm! I am still stunned by the opportunity Tina had to speak with the CBC, with how well she was able to capture what this Christmas means to us, and how it also let the medical team know how important they have been to us.\nYesterday, was a major Christmas present for our family: Sam was discharged from the ward and we are all back at the Ronald McDonald House!\nBefore leaving there was a short ceremony where all of the nurses gathered, a speech was given by one of the doctors to honor Sam for all of the work that he as undertaken – noting especially how he taken such responsibility in understanding the treatments and communicating so well with the team. After, Sam walked out the doors in stark contrast to his arrival by air ambulance eight months ago! He was done and ready to move on – though a part of him will miss the amazing people that have cared for him these last weeks (BMT) and months (Chemotherapy).\nWe will be based at the RMH for the next two months. In this time Sam will be at clinic 2-3 times per week to monitor for potential graft versus host disease (GVHD) which will likely mean lots of minor adjustments to his medications. He has a long list of medications but over time this will be reduced."

Many mornings he wakes up and the first thing he says is “I’m so happy!” On New Year’s day it was “I’m so happy. I am immensely happy!” In the last couple weeks he also commonly adds “I have an amazing life!”\nTaking a van trip our to see the family and bring in the New Year, Tina brought up Psalm 23, a passage that many also sent on to us.

We have been given some flexibility in managing steroidal supports (e.g. in response to illness or injury). So if we see his energy fading we can pump him up a little. The steroids are intended to mimic natural bodily levels, as given the previous BMT related treatments his body is not yet generating natural responses – this is all expected (by the doctors). It is also expected that Sam’s own hormone balancing system will restart after a month or two. Again we wait and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope in the waiting\n\n\n\nI can’t help but remember that when we were learning Spanish, in our days working in Guatemala, that verb esperar means to wait, and it also mean to hope (the noun for hope is la esperanza). So when we say we wait – I also mean we hope. Of course, hope itself is a choice. In many ways it is a choice to expect the good and to actively reject living in anxiety. This is more than a psychological trick. Our hope and trust have true foundations. I have hope because of our incredible medical team, and ultimately we have hope in God.\n\n\n\nMedical plans\nThis week will be a return to regular clinic visits. We will also start a repeat of all of the baseline testing that was done prior to the BMT. This will involve visits to all of the specialties in the hospital, and various imaging tests to evaluate if/how this whole BMT journey has impacted Sam.\nWe will also continue weaning the various drugs that Sam has been on – primarily reducing morphine levels."

    "text": "This past week’s medical journey\nIt has been a whirlwind of a week filled with anxious waiting, clinic visits most days, pain management, prayers, and the love of family.\nIt was one week ago today that Sam had a biopsy of one of the new disease sites. That procedure went exactly as planned and the tissue was sent to the BC Cancer lab for analysis – though we would not hear about the results until after the weekend.\nFriday we were in clinic for a regular blood levels check and a quick exam. At the time, I was asked if Sam’s symptoms had changed and all I could say was ‘No, he seems to be doing well’. However, that would change over the following days as new pains mounted. I think of these as pain-spikes as they would come on quickly and cause changes in his pain management regime (i.e. drug doses were increased). We are thankful that we have such access to medical advice – though Sam and Tina deserve direct credit for sorting out the latest pain-spike.\n\nThe Finding and The Plan\n\nDuring Tuesday’s visit Dr. Jacob let us all know about the results of the biopsy. The new disease sites are the same cancer (primarily characterized by its INI1 protein deletion). This information was critical to know in order to determine what treatments would be available for Sam. To be honest, the medical toolkit is getting low in options, but at least we still do have options:\n\nFurther chemotherapy is not an option. This cancer has become resistant and that line of therapy would put Sam’s new immune system at risk.\n\nRadiation can be applied but is not a long term solution. We will use it to reduce the burden-of-disease on Sam. In particular it will be used on his T3-vertebrae to prevent potential growth at that site from impinging on Sam’s nerves.\nA drug therapy for Sam has been approved. Nivolumab is used for immunotherapy, though special approval was needed to use it on a BMT recipient. In general terms, this drug will take-the-brakes off Sam’s immune system. Specifically, and as I understand it, this drug disables proteins on the cancer cells that allow them to remain invisible to the immune system. This is a very similar philosophy of treatment as the BMT – to enable the immune system, and in Sam’s case to support his new immune system, to identify and destroy the cancer.\nThe challenge is, until recently we have done the opposite, keeping the immune system brakes on so that the new immune system will not harm Sam’s healthy tissues. The medical team will be watching him closely. The goal: release the immune system to attack while watching for signs that the immune system does not harm Sam – it will be a fine balance.\n\nThere are risks but we are excited to move forward with this option/opportunity to destroy this disease. Sam is excited and these options and expected hospital times, depending on how he tolerates the treatment, could be less difficult than he had imagined.\nToday Sam will start this new immunotherapy treatment. He will be in-hospital for several days to ensure there are no complications. Assuming there are none we will be back at the RMH early next week.\nTomorrow Sam will also make a trip to the BC Cancer Clinic at VGH to have a CT scan which will provide the radiation oncology team the data that they need to complete the planning of their treatments."

    "text": "Recap of the last week\n\nCancer war\nIt has been over a week since I last wrote and we have been continuing along two lines of attack against the cancer in Sam’s body.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nEach weekday we have made a trip down to the BC Cancer Centre, about a 10 minute drive away. Sam is/has undergone targeted radiation for the three new disease sites discovered last month. These visits are fairly quick with about 15 minutes needed per site and most of that time is simply setting up/positioning Sam to target the sites the same way each time. Last week treatment of the sites below his knee and on his hip were completed – as these were not near critical organs they received higher doses of radiation per treatment. Treatment of the disease on Sam’s back will be completed at the end of this week. Evaluation of how well the treatments worked will not be for a minimum of 2-3 weeks.\n\nImmune therapy\n\nLast Thursday, Sam was due to have another dose of Nivolumab two weeks following his initial dose. However, this second dose was delayed as his bloodwork suggested that his liver was inflamed and as such it could be dangerous to give another dose. It was a good decision! Over this past weekend Sam has much stronger symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) than we have seen the entire time since receiving his bone marrow transplant (BMT).\n\n\nAs a reminder, the intent of the BMT was to give Sam a new immune system that would recognize the cancer and destroy it. The weeks following the transplant Sam was on a medication to keep the new immune system in-check and reduce symptoms of GVHD. Now that we know that there is more cancer, steps are being taken to release the new immune system to be more aggressive. Essentially, using different drugs, we went from applying the brakes to the immune system to adding fuel to it. The goal: activate/jump-start the immune system to attack the cancer. Of course doing this has the potential to unleash the immune system to also attack Sam’s healthy tissues.\n\n\nThis past weekend Sam had intense rashes and evidence that the GVHD was not only active on the outside of his body but also the inside (e.g. loss of taste, increased liver enzymes). The GVHD seemed to reach a peak on the weekend. Recent bloodwork seems to align with the symptoms we have been observing. If Sam’s immune system continues to settle back down we will likely continue with this line of treatment.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral living\nSam’s life is pretty simple: watching too much YouTube, and when he has more energy, he reads, plays video games (only rarely able to sit up to play on his PC), and occasionally reviews some studies. Lately, his activity has been limited to short walks, mostly around the RMH. He also enjoys visiting with people, though his capacity can often be low causing visits to be short (e.g. 30 minutes). Despite the length of this journey and current challenges Sam still maintains a positive attitude with statements like: “I love my life.”, “I am so happy”, “We have a great family”.\nOur parental pride swelled earlier this week. A boy here at the RMH, I’ll call him B., is about five years old and has looked up to Sam. B. was having a hard week and mad at the world – Sam decided to brighten his day. Sam chose a lego set which I purchased when I was out. Sam was able to give it to him the next day and also spent some time helping him assemble it. B. was thrilled! So great that Sam took the opportunity to care for this young man!\nWe continue to enjoy visits with family. Tina’s family members, who live in the region, try to make a point of being here each week. We look forward to seeing them on their usual days.\nWe also love to see friends as they are able to come through. This past week it was great to see Jess and John with Kate and John (Jr.)."

    "text": "Victories and concerns\n\nSam’s energy and capacity for simple living have swung up and down over the last two weeks. Currently, his energy levels are low – mostly likely related to the ongoing treatments.\nThis is a long journey and all of our energy levels are tapped (physically and emotionally). Part of the challenge is the ambiguity. We are now in a third period (we call it “era”) of treatment (i.e. 1: chemotherapy, 2: BMT, 3:immune-therapy). The previous therapies had protocols to follow and expected end dates. The current therapy is day-by-day, becoming week-by-week… there is no clear timeline …\nThankful that Sam’s pain levels have been stable and generally easy to manage. The main challenges are related to the GVHD, specifically with rashes, which are not painful but are at times very itchy and hot.\nSam has a cold. It has now been identified as common cold that he would have had as a young child. The upside is he has a new immune system to battle it. The downside, his new immune system is like that of a newborn – needing to create antibodies for all of the diseases that Sam has already seen through life.\nNew battle strategies against the cancer have been developed but carry some higher risks.\n\nThe new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam’s immune system to hit harder. Though we look forward to this pushing the cancer back, side effects of the new immune system attacking healthy tissues are also big concern (i.e. GVHD).\n\nSam has had some adverse effects and we need to allow these to resolve before proceeding with new treatments.\nTargeted radiation therapy began last week and will complete this week. We are thankful this tool can be used to reduce the burden of disease on Sam. However, radiation also comes with risks.\n\nWe very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation We cannot thank you enough.\nWe are thankful to the medical team who have explained things incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.\nWe are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where Sam is receiving his care. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) has provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.\nThankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or contact the Westwood Church office.\nThe cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam’s body. The sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), and newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and left shin (tibia just below the knee).\nWe long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease."

    "section": "Cancer war",
    "text": "Cancer war\nSam has summarized this the past two PET scans in the following way (parap hrased):\n\nThe PET scan in February was like someone dumped a load of bricks on me.\nThis last PET scan was like someone removed all the bricks but then threw a single one at me.\n\nSam is great spirits. As the impacts of radiation therapy are behind him, and the effects of GVHD1 are lessening he is seeing his energy return. Today he wants to go grocery shopping with me.\n\nReview\nThe previous PET, back on Feb 14, provided really hard news. Following months of seeing a new immune system be established in Sam (Nov. - Feb) that imaging showed three new disease sites – it seemed that all of the previous efforts were for naught and that we were losing the cancer war. Despite all of the efforts of the BMT to establishing a new immune system, it did not seem to be effective at beating back the cancer.\nSince the discovery of the new sites Sam has received immunotherapy (via the drug Nivomulab) as well as targeted radiation treatment to the new disease centers. The radiation therapy was straight forward and ended a couple weeks ago. With the immune therapy Sam was only able to have a single dose of the Nivomulab which triggered more GVHD2 than he had seen during his BMT3. Although this GVHD was not physically comfortable (e.g. hot rashes, GI4 effects) it was mentally comforting – if the immune system was attacking healthy tissue it meant that it was most likely also attacking the cancer. Most recently, the immune system started getting dangerously out of control by stressing Sam’s liver. In response, he was started on some steroids to put the brakes on his immune system and bring it back in-check.\nThis sets the stage for the PET scan this past Friday (April 5).\n\n\nPET scan results\nApril 5th scan\n\nRadiated sites\nWe have clear wins! No cancer was detectable in the three sites discovered back in Feb. The cancer in his T3 vertebrae, hip, and shin has been wiped out by the radiation therapy.\n\n\nCentral mass\nThe mass in the center of Sam’s chest, the one that brought us down here to start with, is stable. There is increased metabolic activity in the area but it remains the same size as previous – and potentially a little smaller. What is exciting about this is that the only thing keeping this site in-check would have been Sam’s immune system. The fact that this site is stable suggests that the immune system is able to battle whatever cancer is still in this area.\n\n\nChallenges\nA single new site has been located. The new site is located in Sam’s liver. For now we have to assume that this is new disease site (i.e. the same type of cancer in a new location). However, it is possible that is something else. The liver is a big organ, one that is hard to do surgery on, but this new site is superficial (near the surface) just below Sam’s lower rib on the right side. Given where this site is we are hoping that a biopsy can be completed this coming week."

Sam has had such great energy lately. He has been waking up at the same time as me and we have spent our days together – talking, playing, reading, and even sharing the chores.\nIn the early morning just over a year ago, on April 18, 2023, Sam arrived at BC Children’s hospital. Oh, how far he as come along this incredible journey of seeing him return to health. He is by no means out-of-the-woods yet, but now he can “walk-in-the-woods” with us. Sam is joyful, he has increasing energy and stamina, and his courageous attitude seems to have no limits.\nOne year ago Tina and Sam had been sent down by air ambulance and were admitted directly to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). I arrived about twelve hours later. Sam remained in PICU for the next number of days while the medical team stabilized him, and initial imaging and biopsies were completed. It would be 10 days later that the biopsy reports were completed and Sam’s cancer was identified. Once identified, we knew we would be travelling a challenging road – one that was not mapped by any procedures or protocols that the medical team could follow."

    "text": "Major Milestones\nWhat a journey this has been. Sam has been through three eras of cancer treatment: 1) chemotherapy, 2) BMT, and now 3) immune therapy. Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy. Below is provided a quick review of the major milestones.\n\nChemotherapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\nApril 17\nAn alarming x-ray in Prince George provided evidence that Sam needed urgent care at BCCH.\n\n\nApril 18\nAir Ambulance in the early morning and admission to BCCH’s PICU.\n\n\nApril 22\nTransfer to BCCH Oncology Ward (T8).\n\n\nApril 28\nDiagnosis of a extremely rare form of lymphoma.\n\n\nApril 29\nChemotherapy is initiated. Sam will receive an additional 6 full rounds of chemotherapy taking him into October.\n\n\nJune 2\nFollowing his second round of chemotherapy Sam was discharged from the hospital for the first time. This marks the beginning of our family life at RMH. The next months we would visit the oncology clinic regularly. When it was time for each round of chemotherapy we would check into the ward for about 5 days.\n\n\nJuly 14\nPlans for a bone marrow transplant were initiated. By mid-summer it became apparent that the chemotherapy would not remove all of the cancer. The remaining rounds of chemotherapy would reduce the cancer as much as possible, and keep it from spreading to new locations, while the BMT was being organized.\n\n\nSept. 26\nPreparations for BMT, baseline testing of Sam was initiated to evaluate impacts of the BMT (i.e. eye, ear, skin, and lung capacity testing).\n\n\nOct. 15\nSam completed his final round of chemotherapy.\n\n\nOct. 23\nTargeted radiation therapy over three days to destroy the central mass in Sam’s chest is initiated. This was completed at the BC Cancer Centre over 10 days.\n\n\nNov. 8\nTotal body radiation is used to completely remove Sam’s existing immune system – to kill the blood producing cells in his bone marrow. This was done to make way for the bone marrow transplant.\n\n\n\n\n\nBone Marrow Transplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 14\nBone marrow transplant is received. Sam had been admitted to the oncology ward a few days prior in preparation and would remain on ward in isolation for the next number of weeks. This was a particularly intense time as the medical team had to provide so many supports to his body\n\n\nNov. 25\nFirst indications that the BMT was establishing – engraftment. Official engraftment would be established on Dec. 1 based on metrics from Sam’s blood.\n\n\nDec. 13\nSam is discharged from the hospital with plans to continue regular check-ins at the oncology clinic.\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\nJan. 11\nStepping down from all of the various medications had its challenges. Sam was admitted to the ward for eight days to determine what was causing his extreme lethargy. It was a complicated picture as we all had a flu in the days prior but what Sam was experiencing was more. In the end the main issue seemed to be adrenal insufficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmune therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb. 14\nPET scan, that we were all hoping to be Sam’s last before having to go home, revealed a horror – the cancer had spread to three new locations. New battle strategies are brought into play. Plans to return home are canceled.\n\n\nFeb. 29\nSam receives his first dose of Nivomulab used to intentionally de-regulate Sam’s immune system and to turn off specific protein markers on the cancer cells that allow them to hide from the immune system.\n\n\nMarch 11\nTargeted radiation starts against the three new sites. The shin and hip sites would see higher doses over four days. The T3-vertebrae would see lower daily radiation doses over ten days.\n\n\nApril 5\nPET scan demonstrated that: a) The three new disease sites had been effectively killed using radiation, b) the central mass was stable c) However, a new site in Sam’s liver raised new alarm bells.\n\n\nApril 11\nBiopsy of the liver revealed that this mass is not Sam’s original cancer but an indistinct mass that will be monitored."

The PET scan is the big item as it will show us the status of the cancer in Sam’s body. Results of the PET will also strongly inform Sam’s next treatment(s).\nThis journey has been long and we are tired. This past weekend family facilitated giving me a break.

    "text": "Current medical situation\nOver the last two months we have been most concerned about getting Sam’s liver inflammation under control. There have been various medicines used in this. The meds likely helped, but perhaps what was also needed was simply time. Sam’s liver numbers have settled into a safe range and he is now off all immune suppression medications. This is great as, for the first time, his new immune system is able to fight the cancer without the influence of other medications.\nThe challenge is knowing if relying on Sam’s new immune system will be enough – will it be effective? In an attempt to answer that, last week Sam had a contrast CT of his chest, one week of being off immune suppression, and he will be scheduled for additional CT scans in the weeks ahead. He will also continue with regular PET scans to ensure that the cancer has not moved to new locations in his body. The great news is that there has been no detectable significant change in the size of the cancerous mass1. The last known change in the disease centre was between Feb. 14 and April 5.\nFor Sam the downside of being off immunosuppression is that symptoms of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) have started to return. However, he knows that these pains most likely mean that the cancer is also being fought. I don’t know if it will stick but our current motto is:\n\nBring on the pain, kill the cancer, live life!!\n\nTo sum-up the current situation – Sam is now in a wait-and-see period. Our hope is that his immune system will, at minimum, hold the cancer back, and at best remove it. We are thrilled that it seems the cancer has not progressed. We are hopeful that the current plan could finally work. We also fear that the cancer will change and develop again. So now we wait and we try to live life with, and in spite of cancer.\nMoving forward we will continue with Sam’s regular bloodwork and every few weeks complete further scans (CT and/or PET scans)."

We were able to be home and he was able to enjoy his life, time with friends, and time learning at school.\nMoving forward, Sam’s treatment plan will involve the re-introduction of some immune-therapy drugs. Nivomulab is an check-point-inhibitor will be given at a lower dose than previous. Other medications will be introduced in an attempt to reduce the more intense graft-versus-host impacts that Nivomulab has caused in the past.\nSam will also be closely monitored utilizing an alternating schedule of contrast-CT and PET scans."

We chose to drive as it allows for more flexible timing and gives us some freedom while there. On that Friday, there was a minor question-mark related to some of Sam’s bloodwork and the team chose: to adjust some of Sam’s supporting medications1, and to wait out a cold that he had.\nOver the weekend we were able to have a visit with the Frickers and Nana including a nice afternoon watching the tide come in at Crescent Beach.\nThe next Monday Sam’s cold and bloodwork had improved and he was able to receive another dose of Nivolumab. In addition an echocardiogram showed that there were no significant negative impacts on Sam’s heart. Despite not leaving the clinic until 4:30 that afternoon we decided to start our trip home. We made it to Kamloops that night and the rest of the way on Tuesday.\nThis last trip down marks our shortest visit to BC Children’s Hospital and the Ronald McDonald house. It is our hope that this will become a more normal pattern. Yet it is too soon to discuss patterns or plans for life."

When it was time for each round of chemotherapy we would check into the ward for about 5 days.\n\n\nJuly 14\nPlans for a bone marrow transplant were initiated. By mid-summer it became apparent that the chemotherapy would not remove all of the cancer. The remaining rounds of chemotherapy would reduce the cancer as much as possible, and keep it from spreading to new locations, while the BMT was being organized.\n\n\nSept. 26\nPreparations for BMT, baseline testing of Sam was initiated to evaluate impacts of the BMT (i.e. eye, ear, skin, and lung capacity testing).\n\n\nOct. 15\nSam completed his final round of chemotherapy.\n\n\nOct. 23\nTargeted radiation therapy over three days to destroy the central mass in Sam’s chest is initiated. This was completed at the BC Cancer Centre over 10 days.\n\n\nNov. 8\nTotal body radiation is used to completely remove Sam’s existing immune system – to kill the blood producing cells in his bone marrow.

New battle strategies are brought into play. Plans to return home are canceled.\n\n\nFeb. 29\nSam receives his first dose of Nivomulab used to intentionally de-regulate Sam’s immune system and to turn off specific protein markers on the cancer cells that allow them to hide from the immune system.\n\n\nMarch 11\nTargeted radiation starts against the three new sites. The shin and hip sites would see higher doses over four days. The T3-vertebrae would see lower daily radiation doses over ten days.\n\n\nApril 5\nPET scan demonstrated that: a) The three new disease sites had been effectively killed using radiation, b) the central mass was stable c) However, a new site in Sam’s liver raised new alarm bells.\n\n\nApril 11\nBiopsy of the liver revealed that this mass is not Sam’s original cancer but an indistinct mass that will be monitored.\n\n\nApril 21\nFive day break – home! Two days of travel and three days in Prince Family, school, quick visits with friends, and an initial connection with the local medical team.\n\n\nMay 8\nPET Scan #3 indicates that the central mass has grown confirming active disease.\n\n\nMay 15\nAll immune suppressants have been removed and we wait to see what Sam’s new immune system can do.\n\n\nMay 22\nContrast CT Results suggest that the cancerous mass is stable.\n\n\nMay 29\nTen day break home! As liver numbers remained stable and there was no significant change in the cancer from the previous CT it was was deemed safe to make a trip home.\n\n\nJune 12\nPET Scan #4 (since BMT) Results indicate that the cancer has grown approximately 1cm in each direction and that two lymph nodes in the area may now be diseased. The BMT is not enough to combat the cancer.\n\n\nJune 21 & 26\nImmunotherapy medications were started.\nNivolumab on the 21st and Ruxolitinib on the 26th once it became available.\n\n\nJuly 4\nMRI of Sam’s chest was completed.

On June 5th we were told that the mass had not grown.\n\n\nAugust 2 & 6\nA PET scan was completed on August 2. Results were not available until August 6.\nPET results indicated significant growth of the cancerous mass. A further contrast CT was completed on August 6th to evaluate how the mass was impacting the heart and general bloodflow. The disease has now resulted in blockage of both the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Sam has an extensive network of collateral veins (smaller vessels that allow blood return from his head to bypass these blockages). Additional concern has been raised that disease impacts are beginning to restrict flow in the superior vena cava.\n\n\nAugust 15\nStent Surgery\nThe interventional radiology team was able to restore blood-flow through Sam’s left brachiocephalic vein and install a 10mm x 80mm stent to ensure that the flow remained open (see: A Surgery to Celebrate!)\n\n\nAugust 21 & 23\nPericardial Effusion\nWent into clinic on the 21st Sam’s resting heart rate was 120 bpm. Tests identified a significant amount of fluid around Sam’s heart (i.e. in the pericardial sack) – enough to limit heart function.\nOn the 23rd, following a day of deliberation the team moved forward with a surgery to piece the pericardial sack an drain off all the extra fluid.\n\n\nSept 3\nCT scan shows that the cancer has grown again. However, it is plausible that the immunotherapy was able to slow the disease before delays surgeries"

In response to the latest scans we will push on and push harder. Greater risks must be taken. Treatments must be accelerated.\nThe original plan was to attempt an increase in Sam’s Nivolumab by doubling the dose. Given the latest results we have chosen to push harder. Wednesday the dose was quadrupled in an effort to find an effective dose – though it will take a few weeks to know if it is having the desired effect.\nIn addition, Sam is back on high-dose steroids (prednisone). One of the primary reasons to use this drug is to quickly reduce inflammation in the body. Sam has also used it in the past to protect his liver which the Nivolumab can harm. Within 24 hours of starting the drug it was possible to visibly see positive impacts."

Since my last post Sam was discharged following his successful stent surgery (Friday Aug. 16). Through the week we had good visits with family and some big and small adventures. Saturday (17th), Cal, Chris, and Jane were here to visit with Tina and I (Sam was not yet up for visitors). Sunday, Sam had a huge day taking part in the Driven Project. Monday was clinic – news was not great (see below) but afterwards we had an afternoon out exploring new games and hobbies at a couple local shops – it felt nice and normal.\nBy Tuesday Sam was feeling more energetic and we got away from the RMH to visit family in Whiterock. It was great to see Sam sharing stories, laughing, and generally sitting freely with his cousins, Aunt, Uncle, and Nana. That evening Sam and I returned to the RMH leaving Tina to enjoy more time with her family."

Sam also started battling elevated pains starting back on Sunday evening. It was Tuesday night that I was no longer able to keep Sam’s pain under control this was also coupled with nausea. We went to clinic first thing in the morning and the medical team jumped into high gear, taking bloodwork, setting up various tests. By the end of the day it was confirmed that Sam had fluid pressing on his heart Pericardial Effusion. By this point in the day Sam’s pain and nausea were under control (IV meds were far more effective than what I had available), and it was determined to admit Sam to hospital and reevaluate in the morning. That evening Sam’s prayer was that his heart rate would decrease enough that physical draining for the fluid would not be necessary.\nWednesday morning things were looking great! Sam’s heart rate continued to trend downward towards normal levels. Surgical intervention would not be needed and we would spend a further 24-hours in hospital for observation. So many parts of this journey have involved swings. Thursday morning we returned to chaos and uncertainty. Sam’s heart rate had been trending towards normal most of the night but sometime in the early morning it started building again - returning to significantly elevated levels. The cardiology team ordered another echocardiogram and we are waiting."

By 6:00pm he was in the OR where the doctors pierced through Sam’s upper abdomen and then through the pericardial sac to install a temporary drain. The surgery went as planned without any complications – a litre of excess fluid was drained from around Sam’s heart. It was good to have Uncle Cal with us in the anxious waiting.\nSam is a champion. He did the whole surgery under light anaesthetic – meaning he was awake and aware of what was was happening. Apparently he chatted with one of the doctors through the whole procedure reflecting on how great his time at Ness Lake Bible Camp had been.\nHe is now in the ICU for observation. He is happy, his vitals are much improved, and he is looking forward to playing games with us and his nurse this evening."

Much of the intensity of last week continued into this week – until yesterday. Yesterday, Sam was able to be disconnected from all the various lines used during this latest hospital stay.\nThis morning, my heart was filled with joy. It was such a simple thing: Sam got up walked to the bathroom and went back to bed falling back into a restful sleep. These simple actions were beautiful: they were in contrast to how the previous days had been; and they represented freedom and health for my boy."

Time has moved very slowly as Sam has had to endure new pains, discomforts, and continuous testing.\nI am so glad that Sam had the surgery to remove the excess fluid from around his heart (pericardiocentesis). Once again the amazing staff at BC Children’s Hospital have saved Sam’s life and we cannot thank them enough.\nWhat is not advertised with surgery is that recovery can take time – especially if there are any complications. The first night went well, but I think I will attribute that to the drugs that Sam was on.\nBy Saturday evening Sam was feeling gross/very uncomfortable. He has tolerated so much during this journey but he had a hard time with this procedure. The worst of it was that he had a wire tube in his chest and that the tube was sitting up against his heart. The tube was used to continue to drain additional fluid in effort to keep the pericardial effusion from returning. To complicate his medical picture following the surgery his fluid balance … went off.\nThis meant that he was swollen and puffy (e.g. swollen ankles and elbows). This was unexpected. Why this happened did not matter as much as the management of the issue – the team again did a great job of bringing his fluid balance back to normal (using IV medications).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent advocacy\n\n\n\nIt is very important to advocate for your child! The medical teams works hard trying to solve issues that they are seeing. As parents we see the big picture. We know what is normal for Sam and when things are not normal.\nIn particular, during this past week when it was Tina that drew attention to various symptoms that Sam was facing and requested appropriate intervention (i.e. suggesting the echocardiogram that identified the fluid buildup, and needed fluid management post surgery). Tina is awesome!\n\n\nEach day following the surgery Sam would have one and sometimes two echocardiograms (a specialized ultrasound of the heart) to monitor how the fluid around his heart was resolving.\n\nFreedom\nYesterday, metrics of healing were strong enough that Sam could be disconnected1. The drainage wire was pulled from his chest the hole was lightly bandaged. The wire was about 5 inches long with at least 1.5 inches were set against the side of his heart – no wonder Sam had been in such discomfort.\nIn addition, by the end of the day his fluid balance was looking much improved and he able to be disconnected from the IV pole overnight.\n\n\nSupport of family and friends\nOur families have been here to support us. The Fricker family was here on Sunday. Nana has been staying at the RMH while Tina and I have been staying in-hospital with Sam. Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth were able to see Sam yesterday, and Uncle Tom along with Daniel and Alex have been able to have a couple visits.\n\nWe have received numerous messages from friends letting us know that they continue to care for us. Thank you all for your continued support. We can’t imagine doing this without it."

    "text": "Scan results\nOnce again the cancer has grown but we are still fighting. Tina captured it well in her text to some friends and family yesterday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTina’s text to friends and family (Sept. 9, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your love and prayers. I am sending a message I sent Shan recently (to avoid a lengthy rewrite) It is not necessarily edited and may feel raw?! But you need to have an update about what’s happening. We are still fighting so we praise God for this chance 🙌🙌🙌\nWe were in clinic until about 5:30pm then had dinner together …. The CT scan showed that the cancer has grown. Thankfully, however, it has not grown so much that our Dr won’t offer treatment. We had a long serious discussion with Dr Jacob about proceeding with more immunotherapy considering the potential (fatal) risks. It was actually an amazing discussion. Sam showed such courage and strength and honesty that Jacob (and our nurse clinician Julianna) were amazed and almost in tears. Sam said that he would rather die quickly trying to fight the cancer than giving up treatment and suffering slowly. Colin and I are also in agreement with this statement. So Sam will have immunotherapy again tomorrow morning (unless there is something really off with the bloodwork) with the understanding that we have to stay very close to the hospital and have frequent monitoring for the next while (week and a half?). We are also going to go up on one of Sam’s pills (trying to reach therapeutic levels of that medicine) (that in theory - only in controlled experiments - may be shown to help fight cancer). So it has been stressful and heavy again but Sam is courageous and we continue to go forward in faith together …. Also believing this continues to be the next reasonable thing to do. Sam continues to choose joy and wants to have an evening of the three of us just being together doing things (so I might not be available for a call until tomorrow …) We really really value your prayers and presence with us on this journey.

However, by this time the cancer was having impacts on Sam’s heart. In the weeks following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein returning blood from much of Sam’s upper body to his heart. The second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his life. The use of Nivolumab had not been possible following surgery.\nYesterday’s scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single therapeutic dose of Nivolumab had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on!"

    "text": "Scan results\nOnce again the cancer has grown but we are still fighting. Tina captured it really well in her text to some friends and family yesterday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTina’s text to friends and family (Sept. 4, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your love and prayers. I am sending a message I sent Shan recently (to avoid a lengthy rewrite) It is not necessarily edited and may feel raw?! But you need to have an update about what’s happening. We are still fighting so we praise God for this chance 🙌🙌🙌\nWe were in clinic until about 5:30pm then had dinner together …. The CT scan showed that the cancer has grown. Thankfully, however, it has not grown so much that our Dr won’t offer treatment. We had a long serious discussion with Dr Jacob about proceeding with more immunotherapy considering the potential (fatal) risks. It was actually an amazing discussion. Sam showed such courage and strength and honesty that Jacob (and our nurse clinician Julianna) were amazed and almost in tears. Sam said that he would rather die quickly trying to fight the cancer than giving up treatment and suffering slowly. Colin and I are also in agreement with this statement. So Sam will have immunotherapy again tomorrow morning (unless there is something really off with the bloodwork) with the understanding that we have to stay very close to the hospital and have frequent monitoring for the next while (week and a half?). We are also going to go up on one of Sam’s pills (trying to reach therapeutic levels of that medicine) (that in theory - only in controlled experiments - may be shown to help fight cancer). So it has been stressful and heavy again but Sam is courageous and we continue to go forward in faith together …. Also believing this continues to be the next reasonable thing to do. Sam continues to choose joy and wants to have an evening of the three of us just being together doing things. We really really value your prayers and presence with us on this journey. It is extremely important to us and we are so grateful for your love and care ❤️\n\n\n\n\nTreatment review\nIf you have been following Sam’s story you know that in the current chapter of immunotherapy (i.e. post-chemotherapy, post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug Nivolumab has been challenging:\n\nWhen it was first given at the end of February Sam’s liver became inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it again.

The first re-opened a major vein returning blood from much of Sam’s upper body to his heart. The second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect. Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these surgeries – his body needed time to heal.\nYesterday’s scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August, had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with treatment – understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam."

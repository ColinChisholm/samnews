Generally speaking, Sam has been through three eras in his cancer treatment:

1.  Chemotherapy,
2.  Bone Marrow Transplant,
3.  and now Immunotherapy.

Radiation was given both before the BMT and also concurrent with immunotherapy.

Below is a review of the major milestones.

## Chemotherapy

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Date                  | Description                                                              |
+=======================+==========================================================================+
| **2023**              |                                                                          |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 17              | An alarming x-ray in Prince George provided evidence that Sam needed     |
|                       | urgent care at BCCH.                                                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 18              | Air Ambulance in the early morning and admission to BCCH's PICU.         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 22              | Transfer to BCCH Oncology Ward (T8).                                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 28              | Diagnosis of a extremely rare form of lymphoma.                          |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 29              | Chemotherapy is initiated. Sam will receive an additional 6 full rounds  |
|                       | of chemotherapy taking him into October.                                 |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| June 2                | Following his second round of chemotherapy Sam was discharged from the   |
|                       | hospital for the first time. This marks the beginning of our family life |
|                       | at RMH. The next months we would visit the oncology clinic regularly.    |
|                       | When it was time for each round of chemotherapy we would check into the  |
|                       | ward for about 5 days.                                                   |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| July 14               | Plans for a bone marrow transplant were initiated. By mid-summer it      |
|                       | became apparent that the chemotherapy would not remove all of the        |
|                       | cancer. The remaining rounds of chemotherapy would reduce the cancer as  |
|                       | much as possible, and keep it from spreading to new locations, while the |
|                       | BMT was being organized.                                                 |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sept. 26              | Preparations for BMT, baseline testing of Sam was initiated to evaluate  |
|                       | impacts of the BMT (i.e. eye, ear, skin, and lung capacity testing).     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Oct. 15               | Sam completed his final round of chemotherapy.                           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Oct. 23               | Targeted radiation therapy over three days to destroy the central mass   |
|                       | in Sam's chest is initiated. This was completed at the BC Cancer Centre  |
|                       | over 10 days.                                                            |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nov. 8                | Total body radiation is used to completely remove Sam's existing immune  |
|                       | system – to kill the blood producing cells in his bone marrow. This was  |
|                       | done to make way for the bone marrow transplant.                         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Bone Marrow Transplant

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nov. 14               | Bone marrow transplant is received. Sam had been admitted to the         |
|                       | oncology ward a few days prior in preparation and would remain on ward   |
|                       | in isolation for the next number of weeks. This was a particularly       |
|                       | intense time as the medical team had to provide so many supports to his  |
|                       | body                                                                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nov. 25               | First indications that the BMT was establishing – engraftment. Official  |
|                       | engraftment would be established on Dec. 1 based on metrics from Sam's   |
|                       | blood.                                                                   |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Dec. 13               | Sam is discharged from the hospital with plans to continue regular       |
|                       | check-ins at the oncology clinic.                                        |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **2024**              |                                                                          |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Jan. 11               | Stepping down from all of the various medications had its challenges.    |
|                       | Sam was admitted to the ward for eight days to determine what was        |
|                       | causing his extreme lethargy. It was a complicated picture as we all had |
|                       | a flu in the days prior but what Sam was experiencing was more. In the   |
|                       | end the main issue seemed to be adrenal insufficiency.                   |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Immunotherapy

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Feb. 14               | PET scan, that we were all hoping to be Sam's last before having to go   |
|                       | home, revealed a horror – the cancer had spread to three new locations.  |
|                       | New battle strategies are brought into play. Plans to return home are    |
|                       | canceled.                                                                |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Feb. 29               | Sam receives his first dose of Nivomulab used to intentionally           |
|                       | de-regulate Sam's immune system and to turn off specific protein markers |
|                       | on the cancer cells that allow them to hide from the immune system.      |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| March 11              | Targeted radiation starts against the three new sites. The shin and hip  |
|                       | sites would see higher doses over four days. The T3-vertebrae would see  |
|                       | lower daily radiation doses over ten days.                               |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 5               | PET scan demonstrated that: a) The three new disease sites had been      |
|                       | effectively killed using radiation, b) the central mass was stable c)    |
|                       | However, a new site in Sam's liver raised new alarm bells.               |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| April 11              | Biopsy of the liver revealed that this mass is not Sam's original cancer |
|                       | but an indistinct mass that will be monitored.                           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *April 21*            | *Five day break -- home! Two days of travel and three days in Prince     |
|                       | Family, school, quick visits with friends, and an initial connection     |
|                       | with the local medical team.*                                            |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| May 8                 | PET Scan #3 indicates that the central mass has grown confirming active  |
|                       | disease.                                                                 |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| May 15                | All immune suppressants have been removed and we wait to see what Sam's  |
|                       | new immune system can do.                                                |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| May 22                | Contrast CT Results suggest that the cancerous mass is stable.           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| May 29                | *Ten day break home!* As liver numbers remained stable and there was no  |
|                       | significant change in the cancer from the previous CT it was was deemed  |
|                       | safe to make a trip home.                                                |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| June 12               | PET Scan #4 (since BMT) Results indicate that the cancer has grown       |
|                       | approximately 1cm in each direction and that two lymph nodes in the area |
|                       | may now be diseased. The BMT is not enough to combat the cancer.         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| June 21 & 26          | Immunotherapy medications were started.\                                 |
|                       | Nivolumab on the 21^st^ and Ruxolitinib on the 26^th^ once it became     |
|                       | available.                                                               |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| July 4                | MRI of Sam's chest was completed. The primary purpose of this scan was   |
|                       | to provide detail if surgery is ever to be considered.\                  |
|                       | In addition, the cancerous mass was evaluated. On June 5^th^ we were     |
|                       | told that the mass had not grown.                                        |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| August 2 & 6          | A PET scan was completed on August 2. Results were not available until   |
|                       | August 6.\                                                               |
|                       | PET results indicated significant growth of the cancerous mass. A        |
|                       | further contrast CT was completed on August 6^th^ to evaluate how the    |
|                       | mass was impacting the heart and general bloodflow. The disease has now  |
|                       | resulted in blockage of both the left and right [brachiocephalic         |
|                       | veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_vein). Sam has an   |
|                       | extensive network of collateral veins (smaller vessels that allow blood  |
|                       | return from his head to bypass these blockages). Additional concern has  |
|                       | been raised that disease impacts are beginning to restrict flow in the   |
|                       | [superior vena cava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava).  |

| August 15             | Stent Surgery\                                                           |
|                       | The interventional radiology team was able to restore blood-flow through |
|                       | Sam's left brachiocephalic vein and install a 10mm x 80mm stent to       |
|                       | ensure that the flow remained open (see: [A Surgery to                   |
|                       | Celebrate!](./posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html))           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| August 21 & 23        | Pericardial Effusion\                                                    |
|                       | Went into clinic on the 21^st^ Sam's resting heart rate was 120 bpm.     |
|                       | Tests identified a significant amount of fluid around Sam's heart (i.e.  |
|                       | in the pericardial sack) – enough to limit heart function.               |
|                       |                                                                          |
|                       | On the 23^rd^, following a day of deliberation the team moved forward    |
|                       | with a surgery to piece the pericardial sack an drain off all the extra  |
|                       | fluid.                                                                   |

Suzi (and Shawn),
Thank-you! We look forward to thanking you in person!  We are currently living at the Ronald McDonald House enjoying a weekend away from the hospital!  We have our boy back, including his appetite and teasing! He is feeling so much better! 

I expect we have a long road ahead, but if this weekend is any indication -- we are very encouraged.

Sam and Nick,

I was hoping to actually thank you in person before we had to leave you. Thank-you!  

When we left to talk with Sam's doctor she suggested that we could have the weekend off.  It is amazing to have all of us here at the RMH.  Sam is feeling so much like himself and has energy and mental capacity back.  We even went out for dinner last night! 

It was so good to see you here in Vancouver and to see Elara growing up!  I hope the rest of her check-in tests went well.  

till next time, your friends, 
Colin, Tina, and Sam

Hello Otter family, 

Thank-you for your gift! This has been the most intense days of our lives.  Sam has now completed two rounds of chemotherapy. The second round was very challenging but he has recovered from it and we are not out of the hospital, living at the Ronald McDonald House right beside the hospital for a few days.  It is great to see our boy's appetite and mental capacity return.  I expect that the road ahead may be long but the last few days have been very encouraging. 

I am not sure if you have this link.  I have been keeping people updated via web-posts.  This was initially for close friends and family but it was apparent that it was encouraging to a broader audience.  Please feel free to read or pass on to others who are interested.

Jenn,

Thank you for your gift! 

As I am sure you can imagine this has been extremely intense.  
The last few days have been extremely encouraging as Sam has recovered from this latest round of chemotherapy, and we are enjoying a a few days away from the hospital! 

Sam's energy levels are coming back -- and so is his appetite! We even made it to White Spot for dinner last night -- the first time Sam has left the hospital campus since he arrived here back in April (there were a couple other times ... but they were just transfers to another hospital for scans).  

I hope all is well for you and Judah.

Again, thank-you,

Colin, Tina, and Sam

Wow Darren -- Thank-you!

This has been an intense journey. It has been difficult to see our boy be so sick. It has also been amazing to see him get better. The cancer has definitely been reduced and we are seeing Sam return to strength following the last round of chemotherapy. Currently, we are all having some relaxing and encouraging days here at the Ronald McDonald House out of, but beside the hospital.

In case you do not have it. Here is the website where I am keeping people updated on Sam's story (please feel free to pass it on to anyone who has interest).

I think the last time we talked with you was at the Brown's one evening. I hope all is well with you. Let me know how you are doing these days.

Again, thank-you

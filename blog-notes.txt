Our dear friends Tina and Colin need our help and support. Sam has been sick for months and on April 18th, 2023 doctors were finally able to get to the bottom of it. X-rays suggested that he has cancer, and the formal diagnosis confirmed it.  Sam, accompanied by Tina, was sent by air-ambulance to BC Childrenâ€™s Hospital. Colin arrived the following day.  Both parents continue to be with Sam as they seek treatment and a return to full health. This has been a difficult journey for their family, and I know many people would like to be able to help in a tangible way. Please consider helping financially as the length and cost of this journey is unknown.  

Funds will be used to: supplement cost of living when in Vancouver, cover the costs of medical related travel, and as yet unforeseen expenses.

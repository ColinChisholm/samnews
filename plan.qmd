## Main Changes

1. BMT transplant date: Nov 9
2. Updates to the countdown dates.

:::


Following round 4 Sam had a PET scan to determine how his cancer was progressing.  Results indicated that we continue to move in the right direction.  The cancer was reduced in size and remained in known locations -- that is it had not spread anywhere else. However, it was also apparent that the rate of reduction was not enough to remove the cancer by the end of this chemotherapy regime.  

We are currently completing round 6 of Sam's initial chemotherapy treatment.  As this nears completion Sam will have a number of tests to determine his baseline health before starting his bone-marrow-transplant protocol.



## BMT Plan 

_BMT: Bone Marrow Transplant_\

## Disclaimer 

I feel I need a quick disclaimer here as I am not sure I have all of this right.  In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from the medical team.  In broad strokes I think most of the items below are pretty much there ... dates and details are likely to change.

This is the plan as I understand it: 

1.  Sam will complete the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.\
There had been some discussion about skipping the 6^th^ round and going straight to bone-marrow-transplant  (BMT) but there was just too many moving parts.  The team needed more time to line everything up.  This means we have about six weeks remaining in this treatment regime before pivoting to BMT. 

2.  In preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic.  The goal will be to create a strong baseline of Sam's health going into BMT. 

3.  Bone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is expected to be **_Nov. 9_** .\
Following the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT.  The medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0.  Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days following start counting up.  
    -   _Days -23 to -12_ (~Oct. 16): Radiation targeting whatever cancerous masses remain.  The goal is to set the cancer back as hard as they can.
    -   _Days -9 to -4_: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam's own immune system.
  
    -   _Day -3 and -2_: Full body radiation to ensure Sam's own immune system is completely removed -- in preparation for replacing with the transplant/ graft immune system. 
    -   _Day zero_, currently planned for Nov. 9, Sam should receive the transplant.  This is actually quite simple -- like receiving a blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow products and pump it into Sam's body via his central line. 
    -   _Days 0 to 30_ Sam will be in an isolation room with strict protocols.  Tina and I, along with the medical team will be allowed in.  
    -   _Days 31 through 90_: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.

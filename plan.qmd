## Main Changes

1.  BMT transplant date: ~~Nov 9~~ ***Nov 14***
2.  Updates to the countdown dates.
:::

Following round four, Sam had a PET scan to determine how his cancer was
progressing. Results indicated that we continue to move in the right
direction. The cancer was reduced in size and remained in known
locations -- that is it had not spread anywhere else. However, it was
also apparent that the rate of reduction was not enough to remove the
cancer by the end of this chemotherapy regime.

Round six of Sam's initial chemotherapy
treatment is now complete. The PET scan results support the current plan to provide a bone marrow transplant. As the BMT date approaches Sam will have a number of tests to
determine his baseline health before starting his bone-marrow-transplant
protocol.

## BMT Plan

*BMT: Bone Marrow Transplant*\

## Disclaimer

I feel I need a quick disclaimer here as I am not sure I have all of
this right. In addition, the following dates are rough estimates from
the medical team. In broad strokes I think most of the items below are
pretty much there ... dates and details are likely to change.
:::

This is the plan as I understand it:

1.  Sam has completed the full six rounds of his initial chemotherapy.

2.  In preparation for BMT Sam will see numerous specialists throughout
    BC Childrens and the BC Cancer Clinic. The goal will be to create a
    strong baseline of Sam's health going into BMT.

3.  Bone Marrow Transplant: Day zero is expected to be ***Nov. 14*** .\
    Following the current chemotherapy we will transition to BMT. The
    medical team refers to the actual transplant day as day 0.
    Activities prior to this day are count-down days and then the days
    following start counting up.

    -   *Days -22 to -11* (\~Oct. 23): Radiation targeting whatever
        cancerous masses remain. The goal is to set the cancer back as
        hard as they can.

    -   *Day -6 and -4*: Full body radiation to ensure Sam's own immune
        system is completely removed -- in preparation for replacing
        with the transplant/ graft immune system.

    -   *Days -3 to -1*: Chemotherapy to suppress and remove Sam's own
        immune system.

    -   *Day zero*, currently planned for Nov. 9, Sam should receive the
        transplant. This is actually quite simple -- like receiving a
        blood transfusion. The team will hang the bag of bone marrow
        products and pump it into Sam's body via his central line.

    -   *Days 0 to 30* Sam will be in an isolation room with strict
        protocols. Tina and I, along with the medical team will be
        allowed in.

    -   *Days 31 through 90*: If all goes well Sam will be allowed out
        of the hospital but is to remain close for regular check-ins.

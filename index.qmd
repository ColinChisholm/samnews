## In preparation for chemotherapy 

_May 10, 2023_

I'll keep it brief this morning.  We are now in preparation mode for the next round of chemotherapy.  It will hit hard, but I will describe that within the next couple days. There are a number of steps that need to occur before we begin -- I have included these below

## Concerns and victories 

1.    We are very thankful for the entire medical team here.  The care-aid and nurses take on the day-to-day care, each with their own style of care but all doing a great job of addressing needs as they arise.  The support teams including IV, nutrition, and physio.  The cleaning staff who are so polite.  Sam's doctors who are excellent communicators and are gracious in allowing time for dialogue and answering our questions when they have answers, and are straight with us when they do not know. 

2.    There are a lot of unknowns going forward. Sam's form of cancer is mostly unknown.  As such, the treatment plan / chemotherapy will be to hit it with the largest hammer available.  This will be hard on Sam's body and we hope much harder on the cancer. 

3.    In preparation, another attempt to establish a central-line will be made.  As the clotting in the chest blocking access via the arms towards the heart a line will be attempted through the vessels in one of Sams's legs, to approach the heart from below. Once this line is established chemotherapy will begin.  Timing will be based on the next available time... this may be as late as Friday.

# Support

Here we include options to provide financial support cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all enough.

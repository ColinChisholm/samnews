# Weekend review

I am writing this am simply to keep the updates coming. Perhaps it is a
good thing that there is little of significance to communicate as this
past weekend was much of the same -- generally holding a pattern and
continuing on with the chemotherapy -- now day 17 of 21.

## Weekend highlights

-   Nana is here and has spent some good time with Sam. I am especially
    thankful that Tina has had some great visits with her mom.

-   I got out for a couples hours to ride around the city.

-   Sam has struggled with secondary illness -- basically he has a cold.
    He started a different antibiotic and was starting to feel better by
    Sunday afternoon.

## Concerns and victories

-   Friends in PG did a major yard clean-up for us -- thank-you!

-   We are starting to see Sam's blood counts return to normal ...
    though his immune system has not recovered yet.

-   We are thankful that early indications are that the cancer is being
    removed from Sam's body. Though we choose to hope and trust that he
    will see complete return to health, we will remain concerned that
    any cancer persists in his body.

# Support

Here we include options to provide financial support cancer research at
the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, or to support us
directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also
love the support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to
[send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to
thank you all enough.

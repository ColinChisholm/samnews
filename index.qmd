## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly is.
-   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do!

# A Surgery to Celebrate!

*August 16, 2024*, updated *August 18, 2024*

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Clarification

The cancer remains.  We are thrilled to have this victory as this impact of the cancer was causing an immediate/acute threat to Sam's life.  With this battle won we can continue on in the greater cancer war.

## Success

Yesterday's surgery went better than we had hoped!

The original plan was to install one or two stents to maintain the
function of Sam's limited but existing blood-flow (i.e. reinforce one of
his small collateral veins). However, the surgeons[^1] presented a new
plan. The new 'Plan A' would be to reestablish flow through the
brachiocephalic vein ! They were hopeful they could reopen the left
side. They would fall back to 'Plan B' as described in my [previous
post](posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.html) if they were not able to do so.

[^1]: technically these doctors are *Interventional Radiologists*

Plan A was a success! It took significantly longer than planned but 3.5
hours later the doctors came and talked with us. They were obviously
pleased that they were able to do this. Tina and I are are ecstatic! Sam is feeling good! We are currently in the hospital for observation but we expect to be back to the RMH by the end of today.

## Where?

::: {#fn-text}
The left and right bracheocephalic veins were believed to be fully
occluded. The right was occluded when we first arrived due to blood
clotting associated with the disease. As of last week's scans the left
is also fully blocked.

During yesterday's surgery the team was able to reestablish flow in the
left bracheocephalic and to install a stent there to keep it open. This
result gives Sam much more 'normal' blood-flow and takes the literal
pressure off his collateral vascular network.

In addition, measurements during surgery indicated that the Superior
vena cava (SVC) is functioning normally.

## Victories and concerns

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's surgery. The outcome was far
    better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal
    blood-flow!

-   The cancer has grown and the impacts of the disease are threatening
    Sam's vascular system and thereby his life.

-   Sam is on higher levels of Nivolumab. Side effects of this
    medication include fatigue and agitation of the liver. In the past
    we were not able to use this drug for numerous weeks due to liver
    inflammation. Current support medications are being used to reduce
    negative side effects.

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

# Support

## Become a bone marrow donor

[![](https://www.blood.ca/themes/custom/cbs_bootstrap_sass/CBS_Logo_descriptors_RGB-WhiteBG.svg){style="\"max-width:80%"}](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It
is impossible to thank you all enough.

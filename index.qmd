# There he is!

## Reflecting on April 25

Given that the days have been hard lately. It is incredible to say that Sam had a great day yesterday. He was himself, he had energy to talk, even played a video game for almost an hour! Yes, I celebrate when Sam is able to play video games!

Sam's afternoon and ours was filled with love as family arrived. My parents, Gram and Papa C, drove in from Prince George, and Kevin and Shannon, Tina's sister, were here from Edmonton. My parents had a good visit with Sam and we look forward to seeing them over the next couple days. Uncle Kev and Auntie Shan had a good visit with Sam in the evening when, as always, Kevin attempted his jokes trying to get Sam to crack; this round went to Sam – though I definitely had some good laughs.

Upcoming

1. PET scan this morning, scheduled for 8:15am. We will be transported to from BC Children's to the BC Cancer Clinic – just a few miles away. This is a full body scan to provide a complete picture of where the cancer is in Sam's body.

2. I am expecting that we will be sitting down with the medical team either later today or tomorrow to discuss Sam's treatment plan.

# Ambassadors from Prince George

*May 8, 2023*

![Great visits with Hunter this past weekend. Hunter also brought gifts from friends in Prince George. Sam is looking forward to cashing in a gift card for some chicken nuggets.](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/20230506_sam-hunter-cedars.jpg)

This morning as I write, I am also chatting with my boy. He is in great spirits. He is also hungry: *This smile will be a lot bigger when I get food*. In a couple hours Sam will have a procedure to adjust the internal position of his PICC (so no food allowed until after the procedure). The medical team is also hoping while he is under general anesthetic he will also get a lumbar puncture to continue monitoring Sam's health there.

## Reflections on the weekend

This past weekend we had some great visits with friends from Prince George. Hunter and Sam have been great friends since grade 1. It was great to have him visit, and to see these friends reconnect, talk and laugh. Hunter, also acted as an ambassador delivering gifts to Sam from his class, and another bag of gifts for Tina and I -- friends sent us some cozy clothes.

Yesterday our good friends Beth H. was also able to visit bringing gifts from her family. I also love how she was able to bring refreshment to Tina's soul.

## Concerns and victories

-   Sam goes under general anesthetic this am (\~9:30) to adjust his PICC and possibly a lumbar puncture.

-   We are encouraged that the results from last Friday were so positive -- with a 40% reduction in the size of the tumor. We also remain hopeful that the cancer will continue to be responsive to treatment.

-   We continue to feel loved an supported. Friends want to be here with us, and send there love when they cannot. Friends, family, and a broader community of support continue to send their love.

# Support

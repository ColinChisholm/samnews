# Death of our Mighty Warrior

*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::: {layout="[35, 35, 30]"}
::: {#txt-left}
Today, in the early morning\
   Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
  racked with disease\
  and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
  our pride,\
  the joy of life that we had with him.
:::

::: {txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
  to let go,\
  to move on.

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach.\
  without fear\
  without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
  And jumped into the eternal\
   Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us. Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did. <!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
                                    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
                                    that do! -->

## On Grief and Beauty

*How living feels like we are in constant paradox*

*Oct. 23, 2024*

### Arriving Home

#### Re-entry

::: float-sm-end
![Sept. 2022 we went on a hike to Raven Lake with friends -- it is amazing to think of when Sam was strong and healthy.<br/>Samuel Justin Colin
Chisholm <br>Loved and mighty warrior.<br>2008-11-25 -- 2024-10-08](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2022-09-11_raven-lake-hike.jpg)
:::

We did it -- we got home. We split the trip up over a couple of days (Oct 18-19). There were periods of many tears on this journey and this is all so
hard. Yet, we are doing it together -- allowing one another to grieve and cry.

We made it home this past Saturday afternoon.

<!-- We were not sure if we wanted to go home straight away or if we wanted to try to ease-in by staying with my parents for a couple days... By the time we arrived in Prince George it was clear that we just wanted to be home.   -->

Entering our house was one of the hardest things I have done. During that first hour of being here I thought I might break -- mentally/ emotionally.
After more than a year-and-a-half of fighting we were supposed to arrive home together -- the three of us.

This hurts.

*We were supposed to win.\
We were supposed to return home whole.\
Now we return having lost.\
We returned incomplete.*

*Our mighty warrior died. Everything is wrong.\
And everything in the house reminds us of him.*

#### Paradox

The mind is a funny thing. Yes, I felt like I would break. Everything here reminds me of Sam. Yet that which causes so much grief-pain is also so full
of beauty for the precious memories that they represent. The picture of us hiking is a great example. I found it on Sunday as I was starting to unpack
and clean up[^1]. Stumbling across pictures of Sam can cause intense waves of grief -- he is gone and we cannot get him back. This picture represents
Sam when he was so strong a time before any of this ever happened. It hints at what could have been.

[^1]: Unpacking and cleaning up is not just from this trip but from the others when we thought we were returning home. Since April of 2023 we have
    lived in our own house a total of 15 days. And when we left back then we did not leave the house in-order.

This picture also holds such precious memories and reminds us of beautiful times. Times of joy and adventure as a family, and good times with friends.
It reminds us of the love that we share.

Being home is a paradox.

*In the moments it can be so hard to be here.\
Yet there is no other place I would rather be.*

*This is our place. Our home full of love. ...\
Though there is pain and the tears still flow\
  they are tears of love.*

#### Choices

We are doing it. We are moving through our grief. I have no idea how long this will take. I only know that the waves come and sometimes very
unexpectedly. Despite this ongoing grief-storm we are continuing to move forward together. Some of the choices that we are making include:

-   Never fear the tears.
-   Be gentle with ourselves.
-   Accept the love offered. We are starting to engage. We have an incredible community loving and supporting us.
-   Extend love. First to one another and then to those that enter our lives.
-   Keep taking steps -- sometimes literally.
-   Keep getting outside for activity -- accept the warmth of the sun.

Finally, we make the choice each day: *We're going to have a great day! Oh Yeah!*

### Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family to gather around us to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of friendship. It was
        incredible to see Sam have time with his friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked,
        played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here
        in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens' Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca). Sam never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for all the days that we lived at RMH.\
    It was a gift to have a place to stay so close to the hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) provided us a home away from
    home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all through this journey.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

### Oncology Families

A special note to all of the families that we have travelled with -- to those in their own storms.

Know that we stand with you.

-   We will celebrate each of your wins -- we hope and pray your warriors have a lifetime of wins.

-   Should you ever find yourselves on a path of grief -- we will grieve with you. I hope you never have to travel this path. Yet I know some will.
    And you will not be alone.

Sam's life has been saved numerous times because people have donated blood or bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. Perhaps you can save someone's
life!

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of
Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the
support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all
enough.

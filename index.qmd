## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly is.
-   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do!

## Scan results {style="clear:none"}

Once again the cancer has grown but we are still fighting. Tina captured
it really well in her text to some friends and family yesterday evening.

### Treatment review

If you have been following Sam's story you know that in the current
chapter of immunotherapy (i.e. post-chemotherapy,
post-bone-marrow-transplant, post-radiation) the use of the drug
Nivolumab has been challenging:

-   When it was first given at the end of February Sam's liver became
    inflamed and it took a couple months before he was able to use it
    again. During this period the cancer grew.

-   Sam restarted Nivolumab in June paired with another drug,
    Ruxolitinib, to control side effects. Sam's body tolerated this well
    but dosing was likely below therapeutic levels. At the beginning of
    August scans demonstrated that the cancer had continued to grow.

-   In the first week of August Sam received a single dose of Nivolumab
    at what was believed to be a therapeutic level. However, by this
    time the cancer was having impacts on Sam's heart. In the weeks
    following Sam had two surgeries. The first re-opened a major vein
    returning blood from much of Sam's upper body to his heart. The
    second was in response to a pericardial effusion that threatened his
    life. It is not clear to the medical team what exactly caused the
    effusion but Nivolumab and its inflammatory properties is suspect.
    Therefore the Doctors are hesitant to offer this treatment without
    us understanding this very real risk of reoccurance. Meanwhile, the
    use of Nivolumab had not been possible in the weeks following these
    surgeries ‚Äì his body needed time to heal.

-   Yesterday's scan showed growth of the cancer. However, the change in
    tumour size is less than expected. It is plausible that the single
    therapeutic dose of Nivolumab, received at the beginning of August,
    had controlled the cancer for some of the time. So we press on with
    treatment ‚Äì understanding the potential side-effects. In our minds
    this is a better choice than simply allowing the cancer to kill Sam.

## Looking back (the past week)

This past week Sam was discharged following his surgeries. Sam has
enjoyed numerous visits with friends and family.

-   Brian, Beth and David were here Saturday
-   Uncle Cal, Aunt Tricia, and cousins Chris and Jane were here Sunday
-   Nana Mary, Uncle Kevin, Aunt Shannon, cousins Kelsey and Kaden were
    here Monday

Sam has also enjoyed connecting with friends online through games and
social media.

<!-- The only downside to all of this activity is that Sam's greatest
physical pains are likely related to all of his activity -- muscles and
joints have ached in the evenings and sometimes through the night. -->

## What Sam wants ‚Äì looking ahead

> "There is so much I want to do, Dad." <!-- [^1]! -->

<!-- [^1]: It was the middle of the night when he said this. I am not even -->

<!-- sure if he was conscious when he said it. -->

1.  To continue treatment ‚Äì we are expecting that he will receive his
    next dose of Nivolumab later today.
2.  Sam is excited about the start of school and re-engaging with his
    classmates and academics at [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca). He wants
    to try to get going with his studies. He is hoping to take World
    History, Christian Perspectives, Math, and Chemistry.
3.  For years Sam has been looking forward to grade 11 and the [YWAM
    Urban Plunge](https://www.ywamvancouver.org/mission-adventures) that
    the Cedars students take. Sam will not be able to travel from Prince
    George with his class but he is looking forward to meeting them here
    and joining in on the activities (that our Doctor must review and
    approve!) and serving the people of East Vancouver.

## Victories and concerns

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 3 CT scan).

-   Sam is looking to fight on despite continued growth of the cancer.
    He will continue with his immunotherapy -- have another dose of
    Nivolumab. It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective,
    and 2) That there will be no further complications that could
    restrict the use of the drug.

-   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes the
    waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength for this
    journey.

-   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around
    his heart ‚Äì a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well. Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam has made
    it through again!

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome
    was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to
    near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein)

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

# Support

## Become a bone marrow donor

[![](https://www.blood.ca/themes/custom/cbs_bootstrap_sass/CBS_Logo_descriptors_RGB-WhiteBG.svg){style="\"max-width:80%"}](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It
is impossible to thank you all enough.

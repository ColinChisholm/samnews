# Completing round six's treatment phase

_Sept. 23, 2023_

It is early Saturday morning, day 5 of Sam's chemotherapy, Sam and Tina are sleeping.  Today is the last chemo-drug delivery day for this sixth round.  Today is the last drug delivery day for this current treatment regime.  Thanks to our medical team here, by adjusting chemo delivery times a little each day we will get out of the hospital and back to the RMH by mid-afternoon -- much better than having to spend another night which is more the standard.  

Sam continues to take on this challenge well.  He is determined and has made the most of his time here.  Specifically, this time, he made choices to simply get out of the hospital room.  We spent hours sitting on the terrace/deck and in the family lounge reading and playing cards -- I finally beat Sam at crib though I expect this victory will be short lived. 

The realities of not going home after this treatment, and of not starting school with his friends, are setting in and it is hard.  Sam misses home, his friends, and our life there. This is hard for him.  

We also choose hope and courage.  There is a plan and the next steps are laid out ahead of us.  We can do this. 

## Upcoming 

-    Regular check-ins at clinic.

-    Tuesday we will also meet with the BMT team to review how their planning are going.  
-    In the weeks ahead there will be numerous baseline tests before starting radiation and BMT therapies.  I have these next steps outlined in [_The Plan_](/plan.qmd).


## Victories and concerns

-    Thankful for the care and connections with other families here at the RMH.  We are all walking our own journeys with our children in need.  Although each story is unique we find solidarity and some levels of comfort and council in the sharing of similar experiences. Over time these families are becoming friends.     

-   Sam remains in good spirits about the upcoming process (i.e. bone-marrow-transplant).  He knows it will be tough but he also knows that there is hope in completing this plan.  It is hard to see him carry all of this.  He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged. 

-   Chemotherapy continues to take its toll.  His energy levels are lower with each round. The next phase of this round of chemotherapy will see his blood counts fall, an mucositis will likely set in.  We hope that that these impacts are not as strong as the last couple times and that Sam does not need to feel as gross. 

-   Sam will need strength for the BMT journey ahead.

-   In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:  
    1.   We are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam.  We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process.  One option is to just receive blood but the better option is to receive marrow.  The latter, receiving marrow, is far better for Sam but involves a intense procedure for the donor. 
    2.   Side effects both immediate and long-term would be limited. _Ideally, that there would be no measurable side effects_. 
    3.   The medical team have a huge coordination task ahead of them.  That all the pieces fall into place for the best timing possible.

-   We are thankful for the support of family and friends.  Thank you for your notes of encouragement.

-   We are thankful for Sam's school who are looking forward to his return and who are willing to work with us once Sam is able.  We are thankful for his classmates who wrote him and sent him gifts. 

-   There is always concern as the cancer remains.   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

This morning I am writing from the RMH dining hall as my family sleeps upstairs. It is the morning of day 154, and day 1 of round 6 should start later today.  This has been a hard and long journey. If all had gone as hoped this would be a day to celebrate as it would be the beginning of the last round of therapy.  But things have not gone as planned, and this is just one more step in the effort to rid Sam's body of cancer. 

## Courage
I have often told Sam that, though we may not get to choose our circumstances, we can always choose how we respond to them.  Will we respond courageously and act rightly/ virtuously? Or do we react in frustration -- and further fuel the storm^[I think I have said this better here then I have every said it to him]?  Sam has been incredibly courageous.  Facing this storm, this terrifying storm, and he has chosen courage.  Not that he has never felt fear.  Rather, courage is not the absence of fear, it is choosing to face it.  

## Facing Despair
This past week I was exhausted -- mentally and emotionally exhausted, and it was starting to take a toll on me physically.  I was not only wrestling with this cancer storm, I wrestled with my worldview at the core of my being; the foundations of how I interpret life have been shaken to the core.  I wrestled with God -- where is my God who saves.  I have faced Despair and I had moments where I felt that beast would take me. 

I am no longer there.  I have faced the beast Despair.  And I now walk with new energy and freedom.   It is not by my own power that I have overcome.  I am still processing all the layers that have come together to provide this victory^[I may write more on this in the weeks ahead]. Numerous pieces have come together including snippets of conversations, the example of another family, concepts from a good book, and some additional experiences.  

A simplification of some lessons learned: 

a.  Cancer is evil.
b.  God is good. 
c.  There is hope. 
d.  Despite this storm we are able to _live the good life_.\
I am intentionally leaving this undefined for now, and leave it for you to wrestle with.  


## Highlights from this past week

Wed. and Thursday 
: Quiet days at the RMH.  Lots of rest as Sam's numbers continued to return.  Tina and I got out to Cambie Village for a coffee together.

Friday
: Cal was able to visit.  We are grateful for his care and compassion, and conversations with Cal always thought provoking. 
: Gram and Papa C. arrived and visited here at the RMH.  Great to receive their love and the love of Buddy.

Saturday through Monday 
: We had a number of good visits with my parents.  This included them visiting us here and us making a couple trips out to their trailer in Ft. Langley to enjoy the last of summer camping.  One afternoon while Sam had time with his grandparents Tina and I had some time to roam Ft. Langley together.  Another afternoon I took Buddy for a short hike to Tavistock View Point on McMillan Island. 
: Yesterday evening Tina was filled with joy having a chance to play with her nieces Jane, Amanda, and great-niece Jayme (Amanda's daughter), at the campsite playground.


## Victories and concerns

-    Thankful for the care and connections with other families here at the RMH.  We are all walking our own journeys with our children in need.  Although each story is unique we find solidarity and some levels of comfort and council in the sharing of similarities in the struggle. Over time these families are becoming friends.     

-   Sam remains in good spirits about the upcoming process (i.e. bone-marrow-transplant).  He knows it will be tough but he also knows that there is hope in completing this plan.  It is hard to see him carry all of this.  He has lots of hard days where he feels gross and with low energy, but he remains determined and even encouraged. 

-   Chemotherapy continues to take its toll.  His energy levels are lower with each round. As we enter round 6 Sam's strength has been diminished.  He needs strength for the journey ahead.

-   In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to come together:  
    1.   We are thankful for donors who are good matches for Sam.  We need one of them to agree to undergo the marrow extraction process.  One option is to just receive blood but the better option is to receive marrow.  The latter, receiving marrow, is far better for Sam but involves a intense procedure for the donor.

## Become a bone marrow donor

[![](https://www.blood.ca/themes/custom/cbs_bootstrap_sass/CBS_Logo_descriptors_RGB-WhiteBG.svg){style="max-width:80%}](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

We are preparing for the potential need for Sam to receive a bone marrow transplant.  Consider becoming a donor.  It is easy -- no needles, just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.  

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website: 

[https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Perhaps you will be a match for Sam or someone else in need.  

_Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor._

# Again We Wait

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## March 11 

A few quick notes as we head into this week

-   Today Sam starts his radiation therapy.  Radiation therapy will be Monday - Friday for this week and next.
-   A couple victories: 
    -   We have had good control of Sam's pain over the last week.
    -   Sam has had more energy over the weekend than we have seen since before the BMT. 
-   With the ongoing immune therapy Sam has had more minor Graft-Versus-Host-Disease symptoms (GVHD, itchy rashes).  We are hopeful that this means there is active Graft-Versus-Disease.

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Immune therapy treatment was started with no adverse reactions.
-   Radiation planning was completed with treatments to start next week.
:::

The past week has come and gone and in general it has been a good week
for Sam (all things considered). The next wave of treatments and
treatment planning has begun. Though we will need to wait several weeks
before we know how well or if the treatments are working.

## This past week's medical journey

Just over a week ago, on Thursday, Sam was started on
[Nivolumab](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_handout.pdf)
with the intention of ramping up his immune system to battle the cancer.
We had expected to spend 3-4 nights in the hospital to monitor for
potential adverse reactions to the drug. He did not have any adverse
reactions! Sam was thrilled when the medical team offered to discharge
him to leave hospital after one night.

On Friday morning, we made the quick trip down to BC Cancer where we met
with the radiation oncologist. Initial discussions had suggested that
radiation would only be used on the disease site in Sam's back (T3
vertebrae). However, following a quick discussion the team at BC Cancer
agreed to use radiation on all three of the new sites. To plan for this
treatment, the radiation therapy team made some molds of Sam - his back
and the front of his upper body - and then took him for a CT scan (this
is a planning CT). These molds and measurements will ensure that Sam is
in the exact same position during treatment -- ensuring that the
upcoming treatment is very precise.

Compared with my previous post, Sam's health and pain levels have been
quite stable with no significant pain spikes.

<!-- We were leaving from the hospital and there had been some confusion around how we would get to BC Cancer.  An ambulance had been planned but their team was obviously not going to get to us to make our appointment on time at VGH.  Instead we chose to take our personal van.  This allowed us to arrive on time.   Arriving on time allowed us the opportunity to discuss options further with Dr. Goddard.  In addition, the team had the time they needed to do proper planning -->

## Next steps

Nivolumab immune therapy

:   This therapy is provided by IV once every two weeks. This coming
    Thursday (March 14) Sam will receive a second dose. This next dose
    will be double that of the first.

Radiation therapy

:   Targeted radiation of the three new disease sites will begin this
    coming Monday. Sam will receive a dose of radiation to each site
    every day for two weeks (10 business days). Assuming all goes well
    this will simply mean a short drive to BC Cancer clinic for the
    treatment and then a return to RMH.

Results and effectiveness

:   We are not going to know how any of these treatments are working for
    some time. It is too soon to tell if the immune therapy is working.
    Following radiation, we will need to wait a couple weeks for that
    treatment to take effect. ... So we wait.

:   For now the best indicator of how things are going is with Sam. How
    he is feeling. Where is pain levels are. How his body reacts to the
    treatments.

## Life together

*So how are we doing?*

Last week, I felt beyond exhausted, physically and emotionally, this has
been a long journey. Sam reminded me that we have been here five months
longer than expected. He is right. The initial plan if everything had
gone as expected/hoped would have seen us go home this past October.
Next, the BMT process, should have seen us go home last week. Now, when
are we going to get home? Simply, we just do not know.

In the meantime, we are enjoying life together. It is a simple life that
includes medical care, meals, and time together. When Sam has the energy
we get out of the building. Lately, he has enjoyed a trip to a local
bookstore. In our room, Tina and I are thrilled when Sam has the energy
to connect with friends and play some online games (which he has been
able to do a couple times this week). Programs here at the Ronald
McDonald House have been helpful. Sam has taken to playing the drums --
I don't know where he gets his rhythm from but he is a natural. I have
enjoyed playing and learning a few new things on guitar. Tina has made
it to a couple painting classes. We have also been able to connect with
a number of other families including playing some board games together.

We are encouraged by visitors, Grace and Darren from Prince George,
Tina's Uncle Dave and Aunt Ruth originally from England but now in
Abbotsford, and Tina's family: siblings, Nana Mary, and Sam's cousins
are all in the Lower Mainland and we see some of them weekly.

One highlight from this past week was that we have moved to a larger
room. This will allow us to enjoy our space more including providing
some space for some anticipated guests.

## Victories and concerns

-   Thankful that Sam has had a good week. Pain levels have been stable
    and generally easy to manage.

-   Sam has a chest cold. The upside is he has a new immune system to
    battle it. The downside, well it is a cold that is taking energy
    from him -- energy we want him to have to battle the cancer.

-   The cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam's body.

-   New battle strategies have been developed but carry some higher
    risks.

    -   The new immunotherapy drugs will release Sam's immune system to
        hit harder. Though we look forward to this pushing the cancer
        back, side effects of the new immune system attacking healthy
        tissues are also big concern.\
        \
        We are thankful that Sam has not had any adverse reactions to
        this drug. The next dose will be double the first so concerns
        remain.

    -   Targeted radiation therapy begins next week. We are thankful
        this tool can be used to reduce the burden of disease on Sam.
        However, radiation also comes with risks.

-   We very thankful for the successful delivery and engraftment of the
    donated stems cells! To whoever made this donation *We cannot thank
    you enough*.

-   We are thankful to the medical team who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and care give us great
    confidence.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   There is always concern that the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease.

# Friends and a fever

*May 22, 2023*

<!-- Day 34 at BC Children's Hospital.* -->

together

## Reflections on the May 20-21 weekend

Saturday was generally a quiet day. We were excited to receive update
pictures from Joel and Joanne C. as they travelled from Prince George
with Sam's good friends Chase and Ben K. Ben of course brought greetings
from his family, and Sam and I are now set up with our favourite cookies
from Krista. We had an initial visit Saturday evening and despite a
having to cancel a morning visit on Sunday the boys had great visits
again in the afternoon.

An expected side effect from the chemotherapy was a drop in Sam's blood
counts. We saw this over the weekend with a full collapse of Sam's white
count on Sunday. This temporary loss of the body's ability to fight was
also paired with a fever and phlegm. The medical team was ready for this
and had Sam on antibiotics right away. Visits were cancelled for most of
the day as Tina and I watched our boy sleep most of the day away. By
later afternoon, Sam was awake and was welcomed visits from Chase and
Ben -- though masks were needed for all. So good to see these boy /
young men back together again -- Good for the soul (ours and Sam's)!

## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful for friends, and in particular in-person connections

-   The medical team here continues to be amazing. A special shout-out
    to Melissa for the her calm, cool, and constant work as she managed
    all of Sam's regular needs in addition to all of the cold/fever
    related issues.

-   The constant cancer concern. We will not know how the cancer has
    responded to this treatment for another week-and-a-half. Once the
    full therapy cycle is complete the team here will scan for changes.

# Death of our Mighty Warrior

*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::: {layout="[35, 35, 30]"}
::: {#txt-left}
Today, in the early morning\
   Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
  racked with disease\
  and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
  our pride,\
  the joy of life that we had with him.
:::

::: {txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
  to let go,\
  to move on.

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach.\
  without fear\
  without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
  And jumped into the eternal\
   Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us. Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did. <!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
                                                                                    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
                                                                                    that do! -->

# Post: Memories, Sadness, and Joy

_posted: March 15, 2025_

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
I wrote this last week, on March 8^th^, but I needed to let it sit with me for the week...
Perhaps to confirm I believed it ... not sure exactly.

Though our sorrow from losing Sam remains, yet, now there are moments of joy in the mix
with more of a freedom to remember the beautiful life and love that we shared.
:::

*March 8, 2025*

This post has been developing in my mind over the last couple of weeks. Today, the
concepts need to be captured before they begin to slip away. Grief continues to be hard
work. Writing this is hard and I am pushing myself to gather the energy to get my thoughts
onto this page.

It is a sad-Saturday. This day feels harder than most in the last couple weeks. I do not
have a specific reason for today's sadness. There have been no specific triggers. Neither
does this sadness worry me. This grief-sadness is simply part of our journey. I simply
accept it. There remains a beauty in it, as it ties me to the love I/we have for Sam. Oh
how we miss him.

In contrast to today's sadness, I also recognize that over the last couple of weeks there
have also been moments of joy.

## A dream

I don't consider myself a dreamer and I rarely remember my dreams. Even when I do remember
them, I do not consider them to be important or meaningful.

On the morning of Feb. 13, I woke from a dream that would cause me to reflect/ contemplate
for the following weeks. This dream was important.

In my dream: I was back at Sam's bedside the morning he died (similar to my [last
post](./posts/25/2025-02-06_broken-but-building.qmd)).
This was the place where part of me has remained -- the time and place that part of me has
refused to let go.

The difference in this dream was that I was not visiting Sam in the hour before he died
but in the hour after. Sam was dead and I remained at his bedside. My soul wailed:

> *"Sam, I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that you are a memory. I love you."*

And in my dream Sam was there -- in spirit. And he answered my cry. He said:

> *"It's okay Dad. I love you too."*

I would continue to wrestle with this dream for the next couple weeks. I was unsettled.
Sam is far more than a memory. Our hope and faith is that we will see him again. But
though I may long for that time, I do not live there/then. I live here and now, in this
present life.

In working through this dream I have come to a deeper acceptance that Sam is gone. My
conscious mind has known this all along, but my deeper self has needed to come to grips
with this new reality. This deeper acceptance has also allowed for greater freedom to
remember.

Freedom to remember and even find joys in the memories. We will cherish all the days that
we were able to share with Sam.

## Simple memories. Simple joys.

My joyful memories do not have to be the big events that we experienced together. Rather I
am finding joys in the simple memories of life. Like how Sam loved pizza. How Sam loved
his family and his friends.

Sam, we love you. We miss you

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Thankful that we are finding space for joys in the sadness.

-   We remain in the waves on a daily basis but we are also engaging in the world. We are
    cared for. We are having great days – Oh yeah.

-   Our hearts remain tender. It remains easy to get taken down by grief-pains.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family to gather around us
    to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   We are mindful of friends and families – those that remain in the fight to see their
    children through incredible health challenges (cancer or other). We hope with you and
    we will continue to celebrate your wins!

-   We are mindful of friends and families – who have seen their children die. That they
    are in similar grief storms. We grieve with you. Our hearts break again for your loss.

-   Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

### Oncology Families

A special note to all of the families that we have travelled with -- to those in their own storms.

Know that we stand with you.

-   We will celebrate each of your wins -- we hope and pray your warriors have a lifetime of wins.

-   Should you ever find yourselves on a path of grief -- we will grieve with you. I hope you never have to travel this path. Yet I know some will.
    And you will not be alone.

## Become a donor

Sam's life has been saved numerous times because people have donated blood or bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. Perhaps you can save someone's
life!

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of
Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the
support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all
enough.

# Moving Forward

_June 28, 2024_

Following a delay Sam's treatment is now going forward.

Sam is on a new mix of medications that will hopefully slow the cancer and
empower his immune system to attack the cancer. The two main
immunotherapy drugs include:

-   [Nivolumab](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Nivolumab_monograph.pdf)
    -- is referred to as a check point inhibitor. Essentially, this drug
    disables a protein that allows the cancer cells to hide from the
    immune system. The downside is that it intensifies GVHD.
-   [Ruxolitinib](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Ruxolitinib_monograph.pdf)
    -- is being used to offset the impacts of GVHD. Some research
    suggests that this medication may also be synergistic with
    Nivolumab.

We continue to be in Vancouver as Sam starts these treatments. We need
to be sure that Sam can tolerate this new set of medications so
potential adverse side effects are being monitored. The medical team
also wants to keep a close eye on the cancer -- a new scan of Sam's chest
is scheduled for next week (an MRI).

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam's immune therapy plan is going forward. The medical
    team is keeping a close eye on Sam to ensure that he does not have
    any adverse side effects.

-   ~~We are concerned as cancer treatments have been delayed. The
    effects of GVHD caused fluid build-up around Sam's heart making it
    unsafe to proceed with immunotherapy.~~

-   Results from the latest PET scan (June 12) are challenging. The
    cancer has grown. Though we remain thankful that it has not spread
    to other areas of Sam's body.

-   Thankful for a great break at home and time to connect with friends
    and family! Thankful that Sam was able to connect with his friends
    and jump back into school work .

-   Thankful that the three new disease centers, treated using targeted
    radiation, have been removed (confirmed by April 5^th^ PET scan).

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It

# Holding Pattern -- Waiting

_May 6, 2024_


It has been ten days since we returned to Vancouver.  Life has been fairly routine even slow.  We have we been checking in with the hospital clinic.  So far the metrics associated with Sam's liver numbers are going the right direction.  This suggests that the liver is healing/ becoming less inflamed.  

This week we have a few items on the agenda: a) Clinic check-ins, b) Ultrasound of the liver to verify that the non-cancerous mass there is either stable or improving, and c) PET scan (possibly).  The PET scan is the big item as it will show us the status of the cancer in Sam's body.  Results of the PET will also strongly inform Sam's next treatment(s).  

This journey has been long and we are tired.  This past weekend family facilitated me having a break.  Tina and Sam stayed with Mary and the Fricker family (Tina's sister's family) giving me almost 24 hours off. It was great to have that time without responsibilities.  

Sam remains positive and is growing stronger.  Tina and I are glad to see this.  However, we cannot escape feelings of needing to be vigilant and anxious about what could be happening undetected -- the results of the PET scan this week will be very helpful.

# A Break at Home!

_April 21, 2024_

It has been a whirlwind trip back home. We connected with more people
than we expected and yet missed too many of you. I hope you can forgive
us if you were missed -- we really have more love than we had time.
Three days in the city was not enough but we were glad for it! It was
also incredible to re-connect, even if just in-part, with the community
that has been supporting us.

## Travel log

The initial idea to travel was presented last Wednesday, April 17.
However, actual travel plans were dependent on metrics on Sam's
bloodwork that would allow the medical team to decide if it would be
safe for Sam to travel. Specifically, if Sam's numbers were not good on
the Friday, we check again on the Monday, and if they were not good then
the trip would be cancelled. So to keep things flexible we chose to
drive. As a family we have always done road trips and Sam was looking
forward to this pilgrimage drive home.

### Day 1 -- Travel

*Sunday, April 21*

We got away from Vancouver at a good time. It was a cool cloudy day with
some showers heading into the Fraser Canyon. We had a great early lunch
at Horsting's Farm near Cache Creek. In the afternoon we stopped to see
Renee near Williams Lake. Refreshed and fed we travelled on arriving at
my parents as the sun was setting.

We received a loving welcome from Mom and Dad and all of us loved seeing
Sam reconnect with Buddy -- his dog was crazy excited to see him! We
were also able to catch the last two periods of the first Vancouver vs.
Nashville playoff game.

### Day 2 -- Family

*Monday*

This was really the only day that we had any sort of plan which was to
make family our priority. The earlier part of the day was spent with my
parents and the evening with Tom, Margaret, Daniel and Alex. Good times
connecting, talking, and playing games together.

### Day 3 -- School

:::{#Tuesday}
*Tuesday*

We let this day be driven by Sam and how he was feeling -- he was
feeling good. Mid-morning Sam had a great idea of visiting his friends
at school over the lunch break. It was so good to see him simply slip
into life at the school. We ended up spending the entire afternoon there
as Sam joined in to classes. Tina and I connected with staff and a
number of friends as parents rolled in for afterschool pickup.

### Day 4 -- Whirlwind

*Wednesday*

Wednesday was more of a whirlwind. Sam had an appointment at the
hospital pediatric clinic. This was our first connection with the Prince
George team. Although they do not specialize in cancer treatment it was
good to see how much ca be taken care of at the hospital back home. In
the afternoon we squeezed in some visits with friends and dinner with
the grandparents. In the evening Sam was able to attend youth group at
the church!


### Day 5 -- Return to Vancouver

*Thursday*

We had to head back to Vancouver. It was a great road trip. Sam is
looking forward to the day when he can be the driver. In the meantime he
watched the road and acted as a good copilot.

It was a great first trip home and hopefully our next one will be in the
near future and with more days at home.

## Next Steps

In the weeks ahead we are hoping to restart Sam's immune therapy. This
has been delayed as we wait for his immune system to come under control
-- bloodwork in Prince George suggested that Sam is headed in the right
direction. Additionally, he will likely have another PET scan which will
hopefully reveal good progress in this ongoing cancer battle.

## Victories and concerns

-   We celebrate that we were able to have a trip home. So good to
    connect with friends and family!

-   We celebrate that a year following the start of treatment, Sam is
    feeling the best he has ever felt. We are incredibly grateful.

-   Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that
    three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been
    removed.

-   Ongoing immune therapy has de-regulated Sam's immune system. Side
    effects are becoming dangerous as Sam's liver is inflamed. In order
    to continue with the immune therapy drugs, Sam's immune system needs
    to be brought back to a regulated state. Recent bloodwork suggests
    that things are returning to normal function.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

## Become a bone marrow donor

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It

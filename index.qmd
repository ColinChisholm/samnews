# Quiet waiting

_July, 27, 2023_

Sam has completed round 3 of his chemotherapy. This marks half way
through the current treatment plan. However, we are delayed in starting
round 4. With each round of chemo Sam's immune system is knocked back
and metrics monitoring this drop to zero. Before he is able to start the
next round his body needs to recover. This time the recovery is slow...
so we wait. With low levels Sam is also low energy and life has been
fairly quiet.

## Highlights from the last few days

-   Last Friday Sam had transfusions that lifted his energy for a couple
    days. We went out to Ft. Langley to visit with my parents and Buddy.

-   A surprise party to celebrated my 50^th^ with family!

-   My parents came to us here at the RMH bringing Buddy with them.

-   Quiet days at the RMH allowing Sam to recover from chemo

## Concerns and victories

-   Today marks 100 days of this marathon.  I am exhausted.  I think we are all exhausted.  Perhaps it is these quieter days that give us enough space to feel and not just do the work of managing it all. 

-   We are thankful for the successful completion of round three.
    Recovery from this round is taking a little longer. Round 4 should
    start next week.

-   We hope that there will not be a need for the contingency plan
    ([bone marrow
    transplant](/posts/2307/2023-07-17_contigency-plan.qmd)), yet we
    need to prepare ourselves for it, and all the additional experiences
    and time that it may bring with it.

-   There is always concern that the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease.

We are preparing for the potential need for Sam to receive a bone marrow transplant.  Consider becoming a donor.  It is easy -- no needles, just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.  

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website: 

[https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Perhaps you will be a match for Sam or someone else in need.  

_Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor._

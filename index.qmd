# Results and the return for round 2

*June 7, 2023*

Once again I am writing from Sam's bedside here at BC Children's
Hospital -- our second arrival. Compared with the first, this is so much
easier. Sam's health has dramatically improved and it is much easier to
be in hospital when you plan to go there. We are also returning to
people that know and care for Sam.

## Reflections on June 7

Yesterday was a business day. Sam's return to the hospital. We checked
into the Oncology day-clinic, Sam had a few tests, we met with Dr. Cheng
to discuss the progress made and the plans moving forward. In the
afternoon Sam would receive his first chemical doses of chemo round
2[^1].

[^1]: This is the actual round 2. What I referred to previously as round
    to was actually round 1, and the very first week of chemo ... well
    they don't actually count that one.

### Results

We had an opportunity to look at before and after imagery from Sam's PET
scans. I am glad I had not seen the first scans until now. The
difference is dramatic.

1.  The size and density to the cancerous mass is greatly reduced
2.  The impacts on Sam's other organs has been removed -- or is minimal.
    The first scans showed high impacts on Sam's lungs heart -- mostly
    causing high levels of fluid build up and pressure. Now his lungs
    are now clear of fluid and only a residual amount of fluid remains
    around the heart -- this is expected to resolve over time.
3.  Currently Sam has two main masses of cancer. The largest is in his
    chest and a smaller one in his neck. They are greatly reduced since
    our arrival seven weeks ago. I need to get a copy of the results
    again so I can quantify the amount of reduction.

This is exciting -- the cancer is responding to treatment.

### Plans

It is exciting to see such progress though in moments of weakness it is
also terrifying. The remains a lot of work to be done these cancerous
masses are measurable in centimetres -- there are billions of cancerous
cells to be removed[^2].

    3 billion cells/ml*.\

Despite the challenges, for the first time we actually have a plan!
Until now, plans were not possible. Sam's cancer is extremely rare, and
how it would respond to treatment was not known. Now that we know the
treatment is working we will move forward with a treatment regime. The
plan is to complete six rounds of chemotherapy with on-going evaluation
to adapt the plan as needed.

## Concerns and victories

-   We are thankful for positive results and that Sam is doing so well.

-   We are thankful for a plan, though we need to gear ourselves for a
    marathon. We have heard it said around here numerous times that this
    cancer journey is both a roller-coaster and a marathon.

-   Concern that the cancer will be fully removed and that it will
    continue to respond to the treatment.

# Amazing family weekend

*June 6, 2023*

![A family vacation weekend! Left our dinner out at Whitespot. Auntie
Tina with nephew Chris and neice Jane (upper left). Right -- time simply
being
outside.](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/weekend-vacation.jpg)

Our break away from the hospital comes to an end today, yet we can bask
in the joy that this weekend provided! We have had an incredible weekend
as a family and with some of our extended family. It was amazing to see
how well Sam is doing. I don't know if the cancer i gone -- but I do
know that it has been dramatically reduced.

## Reflections on this past weekend

### June 3

Our first full day off. A day of rest and simply exploring the RMH
(Ronald McDonald House). We also took care of all the medical items
ourselves -- medications and needles and NG tube feeding. We had it all
down all the steps were going well -- until we hit a glitch. We do not
have a reason for it, and we have seen it happen a number of times while
in the hospital: The NG tube clogged and this time we could not get it
back. After working at it for about an hour we decided togive up for the
night and pushed as much Coca-cola into it as we could (a hack that
sometimes works to dissolve clogs).

Saturday afternoon we had a wonderful visit with Bob and Wendy H. Sam
shocked me as he was also up for the visit. Wendy and Tina had a good
catch-up, while Bob, Sam, and played on a digital game table. Sam and
Bob broke the game after Sam discovered a glitch and they both exploited
it.

### June 4

Sunday morning the NG remained clogged. We were fairly quick to
recognize that this was a blessing! Sam had a new job -- to eat and
ensure that he met or exceeded the calories that he would have received
via the NG tube. He did not disappoint --our boy has his appetite back.
About mid-afternoon, Tina pulled the tube.

Also in the afternoon we had some great visits. First with Uncle Kevin
and then joined by cousins Chris and Jane (Cal's children). We all
chatted and hung out outside. That evening the cousins and the three of
us got Sam off hospital property for the first time since this whole
journey began! We got out for a meal -- at the Kerrisdale White Spot
where Sam had a milkshake and a double-double.

### June 5

Another great day as a family starting with a full breakfast provided by
volunteers at the RMH. Times talking together, imagining, drawing --
including time outside (outside can be precious following weeks of being
in hospital). In the afternoon we grabbed an ride-share down the Marine
Gateway Cineplex and took in the new Guardians o the Galaxy movie --
loved it!

These last few days have felt like a vacation!

## Concerns and victories

-   Celebrating how well Sam has been doing

-   A joyful family weekend -- letting medical issues be in the
    background of our lives.

-   Bonus physiotherapy for Sam. The elevator at the RMH was under
    repair for most of the weekend. This initially forced Sam to take
    the stairs -- two flights up to the room. By the end of the weekend
    he chose the stairs to keep restoring his strength.

-   Today we will learn the results of last Friday's PET and CT scans --
    the current state of the cancer.\
    We will discuss with the medical team what the next steps are. Once
    again we will be stepping into the unknown. For now we know what
    life looks like until mid-day.

# Support

Here we include options to provide financial support cancer research at
the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, or to support us
directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also
love the support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to
[send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to
thank you all enough.

# Pending results and preparing for round 5

_August 25, 2023_


Round 4 is officially complete.  It has been a rough one with little relief.  The previous rounds Sam would usually have 2-4 days of feeling more normal... This past round hardly let up.  As he was starting to feel a little better he was hit with another bought of nausea and mucositis.  

Sam has a very significant clinic appointment today.  

1.   We should receive the results of the lasted PET scan and lumbar-puncture

2.   The medical team may be ready to present recommendations for treatment -- will a bone marrow transplant be necessary?

3.   Round 5 is likely to start today. This will begin with five days in hospital for chemo-drug delivery. 

All this to say, I am a little anxious this morning. 

## Looking back -- the past week

Despite Sam has not felt great we have had some great visits this week. 

-   On Monday, we had a last visit with my parents and Buddy before they made the return drive back to Prince George. 

-   Tuesday, Tina's mom arrived!

-   Wednesday, Korena and Samuel Z. were here for the afternoon.  This was Sam's strongest day and it was great to see him reconnect with a friend.  Also great to see Korena and Tina reconnect! 


## Concerns and victories

-   So thankful for all our friends and family for your visits, care, and on-going communication.   

-   I am amazed the medical tech. that is available to support the decision making here.  Results of the PT scan are expected today. 

-   This round has been a challenge with much stronger side-effects causing pain and nausea. We have adapted and learned how to manage much of it.   

-   We expect that major decisions will be discussed regarding Sam's future treatment -- specifically determining if Sam will need a bone-marrow transplant.  

-   There is always concern that the cancer remains.   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

We are preparing for the potential need for Sam to receive a bone marrow transplant.  Consider becoming a donor.  It is easy -- no needles, just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.  

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website: 

[https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Perhaps you will be a match for Sam or someone else in need.  

_Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor._

# Catch-22, Intial Biopsy Results 

_April 16, 2024_

::: {.callout-caution}
## April 18 -- Strike out inaccuracies

In clinic yesterday, April 17, some of the medical strategies and understandings of Sam's ongoing treatments were changed.  

1.   Primarily, a lower priority is being placed on the mass in Sam's liver.  This tissue is thought to be benign and _not_ the source of stress to his liver. 
2.   The source of stress to Sam's liver is now believed to related to his immune system continuing to run out of control.  The use of steroids to bring the immune system in-check has not wholly been effective.  New drug therapies have been initiated. 

I have edited the post below -- striking out what is no longer believed to be accurate.  _New additions are italicized_.

## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Initial biopsy results are complicated.\
-   The new growth/tumour in Sam's liver is not the original cancer --
    what it is, is still being determined.
-   ~~This new spot does need to be treated.~~ The new spot will be monitored but is now thought to be benign.
-   The main method of treatment for ~~this new growth~~ _the immune system running at de-regulated/higher levels_ is in conflict with
    ongoing cancer treatment.

Sam and I are up early this morning in anticipation of an ultrasound
appointment to image Sam's liver. It is so nice to chat with my boy in
the mornings. His energy has continued to improve over the last 10 days.
He does not need to sleep as much and he is able to walk most places now
and we are rarely using the wheelchair to transport him around.

## Cancer war

Below I attempt to convey the latest biopsy results and what this means
for Sam's cancer treatment. I suggest taking it slow. The picture is
complicated as we now how two issues to resolve -- the liver, and the
cancer.

### Initial biopsy results

Last Wednesday, Sam had a biopsy of his a growth in his liver, and
yesterday we received some preliminary results. The good news is that
this new growth is not Sam's original cancer! However, we do not yet
know definitively what it is -- that will need to wait for the full
report. ~~What we do know is that this growth is likely a source of
dangerous agitation of Sam's liver, and that it needs to be treated~~. _It is now believed that the source of ongoing agitation to the liver is the on-going de-regulation of Sam's immune system  ... effectively GVHD though it can be debated if this is the right term._

### Treatment

:::

We are in 'catch-22' situation. The ~~new site in Sam's liver~~ *immune system needs to be
brought under control* as it is likely the major source of ongoing agitation to Sam's
liver. This is indicated in Sam's regular bloodwork where various
chemicals indicative of liver health and function are dangerously high.
~~The best chemical method for treating growths like this involve using
steroids (i.e. Prednisone) -- Sam is currently on these~~.  *Initial efforts to bring the immune system in-check used steroid (i.e. Prednisone).  However, the steroids have shown themselves to only be partially effective and an alternate drug therapy has been initiated.*

However, this steroidal treatment suppresses the immune system.

In the treatment of Sam's cancer we have been using drugs to cause Sam's
immune system to be hyperactive (i.e. the opposite of suppressed). As
such we are in a catch-22 situation. To treat the liver we must suppress
the immune system, to treat the cancer we must make the immune system
hyperactive[^1].

[^1]: It is not quite as simple as this... as the treatments are a not a
    1:1 exchange, but alternate treatments do strongly impact each
    other.

*...Ughhh...*

The imaging from this morning's ultrasound, *April 16, suggested that the mass in the liver is stable and likely benign -- it will be monitored but no further action is currently needed.  Medical actions will focus on bringing the immune system under control.*~~should provide the medical
team enough new information to determine how the current treatment is
working and what alternate treatment options may exist.~~

I think what much of this comes down to may simply be timing.

1.  Treat the liver quickly.
2.  With the liver treated we can return to the immune therapy of the
    cancer.

Once the liver agitation is resolved (or mostly resolved). We can return
to managing Sam's cancer.

### Hope and anxiety

Hope

:   If there is anything exciting from all of this it is that the new
    site is not Sam's original cancer. This means that Sam's cancer has
    been stable since the treatments following the PET scan back in
    February. This also means that the BMT-immune therapy treatment
    combination seems to be working.

Anxiety

:   In waiting for the liver *agitation* issue to be resolved we are delaying immune
    therapy treatments for the cancer. During this period it is possible
    that Sam's original cancer could get going again.

## Living Life

### Friends and Family

We had a good weekend. It has been great to see Sam with more energy and
able to engage with people more. An upside of the current steroid
treatment is that it has released Sam to have increased energy and we
have seen more of chatty-Sam. We were also able to have some great
visits. Brian and Hunter were here from Prince George. We were able to
visit family and watch the Edmonton-Vancouver hockey game together. Nana
Mary arrived yesterday and will stay with us for a few days.

<!-- In the hours and days between clinic and family/friend visits Sam is devouring his latest novel, we haved enjoyed playing board games with other families here at the RMH, and playing some video games.  -->

Sam remains courageous, hopeful, and generally joyful.

## Victories and concerns

-   Thankful that the original central mass is stable. Thankful that
    three disease centers, treated using targeted radiation, have been
    removed.

-   The newest growth in Sam's liver is not the original cancer!
    However, it needs to be treated in order to continue on with Sam's
    cancer treatment.

-   Thankful that Sam's energy has increased!

-   Thankful that Sam's pain levels have been stable and generally easy
    to manage.

-   The new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam's immune
    system to hit harder. As the immune system was starting to get out
    of control brakes have been able to slow the immune system back
    down. It is good to know that the chemical brakes work, at the same
    time we do not want to suppress the immune system too long as it is
    the main method of battling the cancer.

-   We mourn the loss of Dani â€“ grieving in solidarity with her family.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   The cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam's body. The
    sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), ~~and
    newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and
    left shin (tibia just below the knee).~~ Latest scan revealed a
    potential new site on Sam's liver.

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

# Support

::: callout-important
## Become a bone marrow donor

[![](https://www.blood.ca/themes/custom/cbs_bootstrap_sass/CBS_Logo_descriptors_RGB-WhiteBG.svg){style="\"max-width:80%"}](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It
is impossible to thank you all enough.

## June 2

We are in a day of transition:

-   PET and CT scans this am

-   Various meetings with the medical team through the day

-   Leaving the hospital for a few days at the Ronald McDonald House

*We are missing home -- glad for chance to leave the hospital though
our hearts yearn to be back home.*

# A weekend pass, friends, and a date!

Today is day 44 in hospital. Aside from one afternoon weeks ago Sam has
not left these halls -- it is time to have a change of scenery.
Expectations are that this will happen over this weekend! As I write
this my family is sleeping and I am only listening to the sound of a
single pump pushing supplemental food into Sam's body. No other lines
are attached to him and no alarms were ringing through the night!

## Reflections on May 31

Yesterday the medical team started preparing to have us leave for a few
days! We will be out in the small gap of time between chemotherapy
rounds. All of Sam's medications were converted to oral and I was
trained up on how to use the food pump which the team wants to keep
going. We are excited to have a change of scenery, to get Sam out, and
for all three of us to have comfortable beds (*we will be staying at the
RMH -- Ronald McDonald House*). Honestly, we also have a little anxiety
to make this change and leave the safety of these four wall. But bring
it on -- let's get out for a few days!

Aria and family were able to visit again. Aria and Tina hit up a local
gluten free bakery. Sam was able to have a short visit with David and
Lucas H. and a little longer with David. We are thankful for their
friendship.

In the evening Tina and I attended a concert! For several years Tina was
been dreaming of attending a [For King and
Country](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3sDbKMebVH2VYcRSl7u1VC?si=6FcIxJJtS6uwiBK8RLl0qA)
concert and we were able to get tickets. Tina loved it! She also loved
huge hugs from Carlene and Kendra S., and Kim P. who happened to be
sitting fairly close by!

## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful for the upcoming opportunity to get out for a few days.
    Round 3 of chemo will likely start next Tuesday. There will be
    adjustments as we take on a new routine.

-   Thankful for the chance to visit with friends.

-   Thankful for date nights!

-   Thankful to see Sam's blood counts returning to normal including the
    numbers indicating the strengthening of hi immune system.

-   Challenges of side-effects continue. Sam, although have a return of
    energy, is becoming physically exhausted. This whole regime, and
    being bed-bound for a full week has led to parts of his system being
    bound -- constipation is significant issue. It will pass but likely
    not without pain. GI sores from the chemotherapy also complicate
    this.

-   Concern, a recent scan flagged a the potential for a problematic
    kidney stone.

-   Upcoming, this Friday June 2, Sam is books for a PET scans. The
    purpose of this scan is to determine to current state of the cancer.
    We look forward to knowing the results. We are excited that previous
    scans suggest significant reductions in the cancer and that this
    scan should confirm that. As always, we will remain concerned about
    any cancer in his system.

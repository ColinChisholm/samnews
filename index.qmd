# Death of our Mighty Warrior

*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::: {layout="[35, 35, 30]"}
::: {#txt-left}
Today, in the early morning\
   Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
  racked with disease\
  and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
  our pride,\
  the joy of life that we had with him.
:::

::: {txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
  to let go,\
  to move on.

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach.\
  without fear\
  without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
  And jumped into the eternal\
   Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us. Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did. <!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
                                                                pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
                                                                that do! -->

# Post: Still Hard

*Nov. 18, 2024*

## Good pride

It has been six weeks since Sam died. Six weeks without him. Not a day goes by where we do not miss him.

Sam's memorial service is just five days away. I have been going through our pictures to share with everyone.

::: float-sm-start
![Late December of 2009. Out for a walk near our house in Prince George.](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2009-12-29_family-pg.jpg)
:::

How can I even begin to capture and communicate his life. ... I have to accept the pictures for what they are -- simple snapshots. Snapshots that are
limited to mere moments of time providing limited windows into Sam's life. Our life with him. His life with friends and family.

Sam's life was rich. He was deeply loved and he also loved freely.

Though my heart aches for him each and everyday that goes by I remain proud of him. I remain proud of who he was and the man that he was becoming. Oh
that I could have seen more.

## Pain

::: float-sm-end
![August of 2016. Family vacation in Jasper. We paused for a photo near the banks of the Athabasca
River.](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017-08-01_family-athabasca.jpg)
:::

I know it has not been very long since Sam died but I did not imagine that the grief-pain would be so bad. I consider how I am doing and everything
ends with the suffix: *sad*. Some of how we experience our grief:

-   *Sad-sad* which for me means I don't want to be with anyone. I hide and I cry. Tina's experience of this is different -- she needs to share her
    sadness and as much as I withdraw she seeks people out to share the sadness. Though different both are real ways that we experience *sad-sad*.
-   *Happy-sad* when we hold a precious memory of Sam and can have some measure of joy in the memory though our hearts still ache for our boy.\
-   *Angry-sad* when I am angry at the situation. When my mind rails at the injustice. Sam's death is just wrong. This is not a place that I want to
    live -- though I have to admit it does give me more energy to get some things done than the other sad-types
-   *Unclassified-sad* the wave of sadness that seems to have no source, no outlet, a wave that threatens to pull you down but you don't have a clue
    where it is going.

I have to admit that I do have periods, an hour here or there, where I am not conscious of my grief. However, when this happens there is almost always
a strong backlash. It is like the grief just builds up waiting for its turn and hits like a flood.

## Good choices

::: float-sm-end
![This past April when we still had hope that we would see Sam though his cancer war. Under the cherry blossoms near BC Children's
Hospital.](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2024-04-01_family-cherry-blossom.jpg)
:::

Despite the pain. Despite the sadness. We are moving forward. We are caring for one another. Each day we continue to start with:

::: center
*We are going to have a great day -- O Yeah!* [^1]
:::

[^1]: see our post: [*On Grief, Courage, and Love*](./posts/2410/2024-10-12_love-courage.qmd)

And we do.

We choose to do what Sam did: Be strong and courageous, choose joy, and give love!

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family to gather around us to care for us. Our community, and our church community in
    particular, have risen to the challenge of caring for us -- assisting with memorial planning, food, while providing compassionate friendship.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   We are mindful of friends and families – those that remain in the fight to see their children through incredible health challenges (cancer or
    other). We hope with you and we will continue to celebrate your wins!

-   We are mindful of friends and families – who have seen their children die. That they are in similar grief storms. We grieve with you. Our hearts
    break again for your loss.

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of friendship. It was
        incredible to see Sam have time with his friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He served, ran, talked,
        played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a happy place he returns here
        in his mind and he is quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens' Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca). Sam never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for all the days that we lived at RMH.\
    It was a gift to have a place to stay so close to the hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) provided us a home away from
    home. This place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Oncology Families

A special note to all of the families that we have travelled with -- to those in their own storms.

Know that we stand with you.

-   We will celebrate each of your wins -- we hope and pray your warriors have a lifetime of wins.

-   Should you ever find yourselves on a path of grief -- we will grieve with you. I hope you never have to travel this path. Yet I know some will.
    And you will not be alone.

# Support

::: callout-important
## Become a donor

[![](https://www.blood.ca/themes/custom/cbs_bootstrap_sass/CBS_Logo_descriptors_RGB-WhiteBG.svg){style="\"max-width:80%"}](https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/)

Sam's life has been saved numerous times because people have donated blood or bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. Perhaps you can save someone's
life!
:::

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of
Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the
support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all
enough.

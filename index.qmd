# Death of our Mighty Warrior 
*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::{layout="[35, 35, 30]"}

:::{#txt-left}


Today, in the early morning\
\ \  Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
\ \ racked with disease\
\ \ and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
\ \ our pride, \
\ \ the joy of life that we had with him. 
:::


:::{txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
\ \ to let go,\
\ \ to move on. 

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach. \
\ \ without fear\
\ \ without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
\ \ And jumped into the eternal \
\ \ \ Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did.
<!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do! -->

# On Grief, Courage, and Love
_Oct. 12, 2024^[posted on Oct 13, 2024]_

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Great days 

_2024-10-18_

These are hard days.  Yet we are managing.  We are committed.  Despite our pains we keep choosing to have great days.  

We choose to keep sharing love to one another and to those we connect with during the day.  We do not fear our tears but let them flow when they come.  We choose to keep moving, keep placing one foot in front of the other -- literally and figuratively.  

The days ahead will be particularly hard.  They hold the large steps.  We are transitioning -- 
making our return home... Yet it will never be what we hoped.  We must learn to dream new dreams... In time.
:::



## Grief

It is the early morning. Sam passed four days ago.\
The cancer storm has swamped us. It has taken our beloved son.

The storm continues -- it is just given a new name: *grief*.

The waves hit us. At times it can feel that we will never catch our
breath. Yet, we are learning. These waves will come and go. We accept
them. We must be gentle with ourselves.

We recognize the tears that we shed are actually beautiful for they are
the love that we have for Sam. The love that we have for him has not
stopped but we do not have a place to put it -- for we cannot reach him.
So we cry. Sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly, sometimes my whole body
shakes.

In time we will learn to ride these waves of grief, to allow each wave
in to become a remembrance of sombre-joy. ... In time.

## Courage

It was a simple few words spoken between Tina and Sam the morning before
Sam died. Tina was getting herself ready for the day and exclaimed:

> *We are going to have a great day!*

Sam was quick to respond:

> *Oh Yeah!* (said in a very raspy voice -- using intense effort).

These simple words have now become how Tina and I begin each day.

Sam was amazing! He remained courageous to the very end. Having a great
day did not mean that he was free of pain. It did not mean that he was
even mobile. In reality he was extremely sick. He could barely move. He
could barely speak as the cancer compressed his airways. But he was
committed to having a great day. And he did -- everyday.

*How did he? What made his days great?*

## Love

Despite his disease Sam kept loving people. He also freely accepted the
love poured out to him.

-   He hosted friends -- greeting them, talking with them as he was
    able, taking part in whatever form of fun was to be had (eg. an "ice
    chip party"!)
-   He loved hearing the notes of encouragement and support sent to us.
-   He welcomed his medical team. He accepted their loving care. Was
    thankful to them.
-   He enjoyed the love poured out to him by his family (Grandparents,
    Cousins, Aunts and Uncles).
-   As a family of three we loved each other well.

Despite the fact that physically Sam was so weak his heart/love capacity
remained so strong.

## Our Commitment

Tina and I have committed to keep having great days -- despite our
circumstances, despite our pains. We will keep loving and we will allow
our hearts to remain open to receive gifts of love given. This is a
choice, a discipline that takes effort.

### Oncology Families

A special note to all of the families that we have travelled with -- to
those in their own storms.

Know that we stand with you.

-   We will celebrate each of your wins -- we hope and pray your
    warriors have a lifetime of wins.

-   Should you ever find yourselves on a path of grief -- we will grieve
    with you. I hope you never have to travel this path. Yet I know some
    will. And you will not be alone.

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard
    work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family
    to gather around us to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as
    we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has
    meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments.

<!-- -   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 19^th^ and 3^rd^ CT scans). -->

```{=html}
<!-- -   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle. -->
```

<!-- -   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer. -->

```{=html}
<!-- 
    -   Sam has begun a schedule of oral chemotherapy.
    -   Nivolumab has been shown to be ineffective and use has been
        stopped. ~~He has continued with his immunotherapy -- had
        another dose of Nivolumab (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The
        therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further
        complications that could restrict the use of the drug.~~ -->
```

<!-- -   Waves: -->

```{=html}
<!-- 
    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.
    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey. -->
```

```{=html}
<!-- -   Surgeries:

    -   A surgery to drain/manage fluid in Sam's left lung (again) is
        being planned for tomorrow (Sept. 26).
    -   Surgery to drain the left-side Pleural Effusion (fluid on lung)
        went well (Sept. 19).
    -   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid
        around his heart – a [pericardial
        effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0).
        We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid
        went well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was
        challenging but Sam has made it through again!
    -   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15,
        see [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The
        outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a
        return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major
        vein). -->
```

-   Thankful for great times, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

```{=html}
<!-- -   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office. -->
```

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   ~~We long for the day when~~\
    Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to

## Recap

### Cancer war

Generally, we are in a holding pattern. Radiation therapy wrapped up a
week-and-a-half ago and seems to have gone well. No further immune therapy
treatments have happened as we are waiting for Sam's immune system to
return to normal/safe levels. The initial treatment ramped-up Sam's
immune system, ideally to fight the cancer, but a side effect has been
that the immune system is running on the edge of out-of-control causing
graft versus host disease and agitating his liver. So we wait. At clinic
yesterday, we changed meds to slow the immune system down/ bring it
under control.

During this waiting period he have seen Sam generally been lethargic with some itchiness related to graft versus host disease.  It is unclear what causes the lethargy in Sam, it could be
effects of the radiation or immune therapy, it could be the disease, all
of the above or something else ... We do get glimpses of the real Sam
full of energy and life. These times are encouraging though it is hard
to watch him drop back to lethargy.

## April 4 addition

In the last 3-4 days Sam has had much better energy... I hope it continues.
:::


Generally, we are in a very ambiguous situation -- not knowing what is
happening with the cancer or if the treatments are having the desired
effects. Sam will have a PET scan tomorrow (Friday, April 5) which should give us a picture of where things are at. 

### Living life and special memories

The previous two weeks have been busy. In adddition to medical appointments we had good visits with friends, family, and we attended a couple hockey games.

#### Friends and family

We have been encouraged by visits with friends. Most importantly --
Sam's friends. It was spring break for the schools and a few friends
were able to visit during this time.

Chase came and stayed with us/Sam for a number of days. Ben, along with
the rest of his family, was able to visit a couple different times. I am
thankful that these boys were able see Sam when he was up and when he
was down and simply accept him where he was at.

We also love the times we can connect with family, here at the RMH, at
their homes, and at a hockey game.

#### Hockey

Sam has really been enjoying hockey during this difficult period. He
looks forward to watching games. Since I last wrote we were able to
attend two.

First, we attended the WHL's Vancouver Giants versus Kelowna Rockets.
This was a special family time as we were gifted box seats to the game.
Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the
three of us plus Chase there.

This past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the
Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time
together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each
of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with
a party atmosphere at the arena!

## Upcoming

We will be at clinic 2-3 times this week. Sam will have a PET scan tomorrow (Friday, April 5).

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam's energy and capacity for simple living have swung up and down
    over the last month. The majority of the time his energy is low but
    we do get glimpses of our real Sam full of energy and life.

-   The ambiguity of not knowing if treatments are working and delays in
    treatment are challenging -- to the point of terrifying. We have
    managed the not-knowing well, but our reserves/defenses are
    drained/weakened.

-   Thankful that Sam's pain levels have been stable and generally easy
    to manage. The main challenges are related to the GVHD, specifically
    with rashes, which are not painful but are at times very itchy and
    hot.

-   The new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam's immune
    system to hit harder. Though we look forward to this pushing the
    cancer back, side effects of the new immune system attacking healthy
    tissues are also big concern (i.e. GVHD). Sam has had some adverse
    effects and we need to allow these to resolve before proceeding with
    new treatments.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things incredibly well and who have
    worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication,
    compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   The cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam's body. The
    sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), and
    newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and
    left shin (tibia just below the knee).

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

## Become a bone marrow donor

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate their bone
marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles, just a
cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at
the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us
directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also
love the support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to
[send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to
thank you all enough.

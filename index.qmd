# Victories and challenges -- we battle on
_April 7, 2024_

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## April 9

Sam has a biopsy of the new potential disease site in his liver tomorrow.  We have a lot of concern about this new site.  Sam will likely be in hospital for 1-2 nights for observation.

## Cancer war

Sam has summarized this the past two PET scans in the following way
(paraphrased):

> The PET scan in February was like someone dumped a load of bricks on
> me.\
> This last PET scan was like someone removed all the bricks but then
> threw a single one at me.

Sam is great spirits. As the impacts of radiation therapy are behind
him, and the effects of GVHD[^1] are lessening he is seeing his energy
return. Today he wants to go grocery shopping with me.

[^1]: Graft versus host disease

### Review

The previous PET, back on Feb 14, provided really hard news. Following
months of seeing a new immune system be established in Sam (Nov. - Feb)
that imaging showed three new disease sites -- it seemed that all of the
previous efforts were for naught and that we were losing the cancer war.
Despite all of the efforts of the BMT to establishing a new immune
system, it did not seem to be effective at beating back the cancer.

Since the discovery of the new sites Sam has received immunotherapy (via
the drug Nivomulab) as well as targeted radiation treatment to the new
disease centers. The radiation therapy was straight forward and ended a
couple weeks ago. With the immune therapy Sam was only able to have a
single dose of the Nivomulab which triggered more GVHD[^2] than he had
seen during his BMT[^3]. Although this GVHD was not physically
comfortable (e.g. hot rashes, GI[^4] effects) it was mentally comforting
-- if the immune system was attacking healthy tissue it meant that it
was most likely also attacking the cancer. Most recently, the immune
system started getting dangerously out of control by stressing Sam's
liver. In response, he was started on some steroids to put the brakes on
his immune system and bring it back in-check.

[^2]: Graft versus host disease

[^3]: Bone marrow transplant

[^4]: gastrointestinal

This sets the stage for the PET scan this past Friday (April 5).

### PET scan results

*April 5^th^ scan*

#### Radiated sites

We have clear wins! No cancer was detectable in the three sites
discovered back in Feb. The cancer in his T3 vertebrae, hip, and shin
has been wiped out by the radiation therapy.

#### Central mass

The mass in the center of Sam's chest, the one that brought us down here
to start with, is stable. There is increased metabolic activity in the
area but it remains the same size as previous -- and potentially a
little smaller. What is exciting about this is that the only thing
keeping this site in-check would have been Sam's immune system. The fact
that this site is stable suggests that the immune system is able to
battle whatever cancer is still in this area.

#### Challenges

A single new site has been located. The new site is located in Sam's
liver. For now we have to assume that this is new disease site (i.e. the
same type of cancer in a new location). However, it is possible that is
something else. The liver is a big organ, one that is hard to do surgery
on, but this new site is superficial (near the surface) just below Sam's
lower rib on the right side. Given where this site is we are hoping that
a biopsy can be completed this coming week.

## Living Life

### Friends and Family

Although not planned this way it was great to have my parents visit this
weekend. Initial scheduling of the PET scan was not until next week. I
am glad they were here to be with us -- PET scans are often stressful.
Nana Mary, Uncles Kevin and Cal were also able to come in the afternoon
that we received the PET scan results.

Yesterday, Tina and I were able to visit with Brian, Beth, David, and
Luke. A definitely highlight from that visit was seeing Sam have energy
to talk with his friend!

### Tragedy

Yesterday's visits were filled with joy. But the day was also filled
with sorrow. Our hearts break for R, and her whole family, as
her daughter Dani passed away in the early morning. Dani had fought hard. 


## Victories and concerns

-   Thankful that three disease centers have been removed. Thankful
    that the original central mass is stable. We battle on to determine
    what the latest site is and how best to attack it.

-   Thankful that Sam's energy has increased!

-   Thankful that Sam's pain levels have been stable and generally easy
    to manage.

-   The new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam's immune
    system to hit harder. As the immune system was starting to get out
    of control brakes have been able to slow the immune system back
    down. It is good to know that the chemical brakes work, at the same
    time we do not want to suppress the immune system too long as it is
    the main method of battling the cancer.

-   We mourn the loss of Dani â€“ grieving in solidarity with her family.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   The cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam's body. The
    sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), ~~and
    newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and
    left shin (tibia just below the knee).~~ Latest scan revealed a potential new site on Sam's liver. 

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

## Recap

### Cancer war

Generally, we are in a holding pattern. Radiation therapy wrapped up a
week-and-a-half ago and seems to have gone well. No further immune therapy
treatments have happened as we are waiting for Sam's immune system to
return to normal/safe levels. The initial treatment ramped-up Sam's
immune system, ideally to fight the cancer, but a side effect has been
that the immune system is running on the edge of out-of-control causing
graft versus host disease and agitating his liver. So we wait. At clinic
yesterday, we changed meds to slow the immune system down/ bring it
under control.

During this waiting period he have seen Sam generally been lethargic with some itchiness related to graft versus host disease.  It is unclear what causes the lethargy in Sam, it could be
effects of the radiation or immune therapy, it could be the disease, all
of the above or something else ... We do get glimpses of the real Sam
full of energy and life. These times are encouraging though it is hard
to watch him drop back to lethargy.  

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## April 4 addition

In the last 3-4 days Sam has had much better energy... I hope it continues.
:::


Generally, we are in a very ambiguous situation -- not knowing what is
happening with the cancer or if the treatments are having the desired
effects. Sam will have a PET scan tomorrow (Friday, April 5) which should give us a picture of where things are at. 

### Living life and special memories

The previous two weeks have been busy. In adddition to medical appointments we had good visits with friends, family, and we attended a couple hockey games.

#### Friends and family

We have been encouraged by visits with friends. Most importantly --
Sam's friends. It was spring break for the schools and a few friends
were able to visit during this time.

Chase came and stayed with us/Sam for a number of days. Ben, along with
the rest of his family, was able to visit a couple different times. I am
thankful that these boys were able see Sam when he was up and when he
was down and simply accept him where he was at.

We also love the times we can connect with family, here at the RMH, at
their homes, and at a hockey game.

#### Hockey

Sam has really been enjoying hockey during this difficult period. He
looks forward to watching games. Since I last wrote we were able to
attend two.

First, we attended the WHL's Vancouver Giants versus Kelowna Rockets.
This was a special family time as we were gifted box seats to the game.
Family including Cal, Tricia, Jane, and Nana Mary were able to meet the
three of us plus Chase there.

This past Friday (Feb. 29), The three of us were able to attend the
Vancouver Canucks versus Dallas Stars game. We had a great time
together! Sam enjoyed it so much and this will be a core memory for each
of us. Although Vancouver lost it was a great hard-fought game and with
a party atmosphere at the arena!

## Upcoming

We will be at clinic 2-3 times this week. Sam will have a PET scan tomorrow (Friday, April 5).

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam's energy and capacity for simple living have swung up and down
    over the last month. The majority of the time his energy is low but
    we do get glimpses of our real Sam full of energy and life.

-   The ambiguity of not knowing if treatments are working and delays in
    treatment are challenging -- to the point of terrifying. We have
    managed the not-knowing well, but our reserves/defenses are
    drained/weakened.

-   Thankful that Sam's pain levels have been stable and generally easy
    to manage. The main challenges are related to the GVHD, specifically
    with rashes, which are not painful but are at times very itchy and
    hot.

-   The new immunotherapy drugs seems to have released Sam's immune
    system to hit harder. Though we look forward to this pushing the
    cancer back, side effects of the new immune system attacking healthy
    tissues are also big concern (i.e. GVHD). Sam has had some adverse
    effects and we need to allow these to resolve before proceeding with
    new treatments.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things incredibly well and who have
    worked professionally and confidently. Your clear communication,
    compassion, and medical care give us great confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   The cancer remains and has spread to new areas in Sam's body. The
    sites are a mass in the center of his chest (the original), and
    newer sites in his back (T3 vertebrae), his hip (right ilium), and
    left shin (tibia just below the knee).

-   We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate their bone
marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles, just a
cheek swab that you can do yourself.

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

<https://makeallthedifference.blood.ca/stem-cells-1/>

Perhaps you can save someone's life!

*Note: You need to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to become a donor.*

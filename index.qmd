# Contingency planning

_July 18, 2023_

Sam had a clinic appointment this past Friday and honestly I had to let that conversation sit for a number of days before presenting it here.  It was a really important conversation, one that I very much appreciated as the team is being proactive in Sam's treatment.  Despite this, I received it like a gut-punch. 

What it came down to is making a contingency plan.  Sam's cancer is unknown and as such it is impossible to know if the current treatment will be fully effective.  If it is not, then what next?  We discussed the possibility of following the current treatment up with a bone marrow transplant.  There is quite a lot of planning needed to move forward with a such a procedure as a donor needs to be found.  So we are starting now. 

The bone marrow transplant treatment, if needed, would start following the current treatment (~early Oct), and would add some significant time to our stay down here.  

If it is needed, of course we will do it.  We just hope that it is not needed.

## Become a bone marrow donor

It is easy to become a donor -- no needles, just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.  

Register via Canada Blood Services' stem cell donor website:

Perhaps you will be a match for Sam or someone else in need.

## The past few days -- including a hospital visit 

This past weekend has been very quiet.  As a family we managed one outing on Friday night to visit Uncle Kev.  The remainder of our days have at RMH and for the most part in our room here.  Sam is mid-way through this cycle of chemotherapy and as expected his blood counts are falling.  This means that his energy levels are low, and that his immune system is compromised. The best thing we can do is keep him from getting sick -- hide away until his system starts recovering.  

### Hospital ER visit

Last night we paid a visit to the ER.  Sam was having chest pain and headaches that would come in waves.  The medical team pursued the potential for a blood embolus (throwing a clot) ordering ECGs, bloodwork, and a CT. After a few hours these pains subsided, and the tests were all clear.  So a bit of a mystery but good that there was nothing serious. 

## Concerns and victories

-   Thankful that we can easily access to care here and the amazing medical team.

-   We are thankful for the successful completion of round three's drug
    delivery phase!  So far the side effects have been minimal.  Sam is currently in the valley trying to avoid any secondary infections / flu, etc.

-   We hope that there will not be a need for the contingency plan, yet we need to prepare ourselves for it, and all the additional time may bring with it.

-   Last's nights visit made us remember the blood clots associated with this cancer.  Sam's current medicines should keep them from being an issue but they remain a background concern.


-   There is always concern that the cancer remains.  We long for the day when Sam is clear of this disease.

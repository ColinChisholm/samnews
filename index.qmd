## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly is.
-   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do!

# Highs, Lows and Another Surgery

*August 23, 2024*


::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   We are back in hospital as there is fluid around Sam's heart. 
-   This afternoon, Aug. 23, Sam had a surgery to reduce the fluid around his heart.
-   Despite the current challenges Sam had a good week with adventures,
    and time with family.
:::

It has been a roller coaster of a week from good times with friends,
family, and the [Driven
Project](https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/)
experience to the lows of uncontrolled pain and re-admission to the
hospital. Sam is mostly feeling better now and we are hopeful that he
can be released from hospital soon.

## Highs

This past week started strong. Since my last post Sam was discharged
following his successful [stent
surgery](./posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd) (Friday Aug. 16). Through
the week we had good visits with family and some big and small
adventures. Saturday (17^th^), Cal, Chris, and Jane were here to visit
with Tina and I (Sam was not yet up for visitors). Sunday, Sam had a
huge day taking part in the [Driven
Project](https://drivenproject.org/past-events/vancouver-2024/). Monday
was clinic -- news was not great (see below) but afterwards we had an
afternoon out exploring new games and hobbies at a couple local shops --
it felt nice and normal.

By Tuesday Sam was feeling more energetic and we got away from the RMH
to visit family in Whiterock. It was great to see Sam sharing stories,
laughing, and generally sitting freely with his cousins, Aunt, Uncle,
and Nana. That evening Sam and I returned to the RMH leaving Tina to
enjoy more time with her family.

## Lows

Ack, what a roller coaster this week. Monday in clinic Sam's liver
number showed a sudden spike upwards. This was confirmed again on
Tuesday. Sam also started battling elevated pains starting back on
Sunday evening. It was Tuesday night that I was no longer able to keep
Sam's pain under control this was also coupled with nausea. We went to
clinic first thing in the morning and the medical team jumped into high
gear, taking bloodwork, setting up various tests. By the end of the day
it was confirmed that Sam had fluid pressing on his heart -- a [Pericardial
Effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). By that
point in the day Sam's pain and nausea were under control (IV meds were
far more effective than what I had available), and it was determined to
admit Sam to hospital and reevaluate in the morning. 
<!-- That evening Sam's
prayer was that his heart rate would decrease enough that physical
draining for the fluid would not be necessary. -->

Wednesday morning things were looking great! Sam's heart rate continued
to trend downward towards normal levels. It seemed surgical intervention would not
be needed and we would spend a further 24-hours in hospital for
observation. So many parts of this journey have involved swings.
Thursday morning we returned to chaos and uncertainty. Sam's heart rate
had been trending towards normal most of the night but sometime in the
early morning it started building again - returning to significantly
elevated levels.

## Surgery & Intensive Care

As I finish writing this post the three of us are in the intensive care. The day has been very intense but we are now in a good place.  Mid-afternoon, the medical team decided that it would safest for Sam to go
forward with a surgery to remove the fluid from his around his heart. By 6:00pm he
was in the OR where the doctors pieced through Sam's upper abdomen and
then through pericardial sack to install a temporary drain. The surgery
went as planned without any complications. 

Sam is a champion. He did the
whole surgery under light anesthetic -- meaning he was awake and aware of 
what was was happening. Apparently he chatted with one of the doctors through the whole procedure
reflecting on how great his time at Ness Lake Bible Camp had been.  

He is now in the ICU for observation.  He is happy, his vitals are much 
improved, and he is looking forward to playing games with us and his 
nurse this evening.

## Victories and concerns

-   Sam had fluid around his heart â€“ a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We are 
    thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went well. 
    Sam's vitals are much improved. 

-   We are celebrate the success of Sam's stent surgery (see
    [here](./posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome was far
    better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to near-normal
    blood-flow!

-   The cancer has grown and the impacts of the disease are threatening
    Sam's vascular system and thereby his life.

-   Sam is on higher levels of Nivolumab. Side effects of this
    medication include fatigue and agitation of the liver. In the past
    we were not able to use this drug for numerous weeks due to liver
    inflammation. Current support medications are being used to reduce
    negative side effects.

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need something that will work. We need a miracle.

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to where
    Sam is receiving his care. The [Ronald McDonald House
    (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has provided us a home away from home. This
    place is an amazing example of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam whereever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

Sam's life has been saved in part because someone was will to donate
their bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. It is easy -- no needles,
just a cheek swab that you can do yourself.

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer
research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House,
Friends of Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to
support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so
many. We also love the support provided in words of encouragement.
Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It

# Death of our Mighty Warrior

*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::: {layout="[35, 35, 30]"}
::: {#txt-left}
Today, in the early morning\
   Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
  racked with disease\
  and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
  our pride,\
  the joy of life that we had with him.
:::

::: {txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
  to let go,\
  to move on.

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach.\
  without fear\
  without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
  And jumped into the eternal\
   Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us. Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did. <!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
                                                                                    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
                                                                                    that do! -->

# Post: Integrity, Loss and Restoration

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## May 19, 2025

I wrote this a month ago. I am not sure why I have sat on these ideas so long before
sharing them.\
Perhaps I wanted to ensure I believed my own words, or maybe I wanted to ensure that the
two of us were in a similar space. Alternately, it may simply be that we have not had the
energy or motivation to complete our final edits.

The ideas below continue to hold true.\
The journey remains hard.\
The waves of grief still come, and\
At times, it can feel like we can be lost in grief...

Thank you for continuing to care and to take this hard road alongside us.
:::

**April 14, 2025**

Integrity has always been one of my/our core values. That what I do and say aligns with
what I think and believe. Yet as I reflect on my current state of life I am left to wonder
if I have fallen into a dual-life: One life of loss; the other life of finding a new way
of living. These lives don't seem to align and this incongruent-living can lead to
feelings of guilt. I think I have this sorted out better now ... the thoughts below were
part of doing that.

Why is it that all these months later that the pain of loss seems to grow. This is likely
a wave. The emotional waves remain strong rising to the same highs and lows... though the
violence of the transitions are not always as sharp.

Over the last month there have been many days that I need to spend time crying before I
continue on with the rest of my day. There is no right way to cry. My cries are quiet as
tears escape my eyes. In contrast, Tina's cries can be wails. Our individual responses to
grief are consistent with who we are and though we grieve individually, we also grieve
together.

Despite these grief-pains we continue to push on -- to try to live life. Tina continues to
volunteer at Sam's school. She has loved connecting with the staff, other parents, and
especially with Sam's classmates during their lunch break once a week. This lunch-club is
a highlight for her as well as the students. Tina remains Tina -- pouring out love to
people.

In general, I have been able to enjoy my work -- now at \~3/4 time. I have a great team,
and we take on interesting and challenging problems. Earlier this week we had a day filled
with meetings with other organizations. I could not help but enjoy them, all the different
conversations and the ideas exchanged. I know Sam would have been proud to hear about it
-- he was always proud of his working-Dad. To have a day like that can result in an
emotional backlash and by the end of the day I faced an emotion that has been more and
more common.

I felt guilt. Guilt when I enjoy my work. Guilt when I I find joy in life. Guilt when my
grief-pains fail to hold me back from living. Reflecting on my day filled with meetings,
unless people knew our story, I expect no one would have been able to tell that anything
was wrong. But Sam is gone and therefore everything is wrong.

## Two spheres

Do you see it? The dual-living?

One life where we learn to have joys, find satisfaction in tasks, where we seem to live
well without Sam. The other life with our loss is near-all-consumingly-present and to
which I now add feelings of guilt. It has been hard to accept the conflict/ dissonance of
these two ways of living. It seems like I am not being true -- that I lack some level of
integrity.

I discussed these ideas with my counselor, and that was a really freeing session. In their
practice they have a model of grief that lines up incredibly well with what I have been
experiencing. Their model of grief presents the need to live in two spheres: one sphere of
loss, and the other is the sphere of restoration (i.e. restoring/rebuilding life-without).
As we work through our grief it is neither possible or healthy to live in one or the
other. Rather we must discover the freedom to move between these spheres.

I had been mistaken, the integrity of living is not in living in one sphere or the other
(loss or restoration). Rather living with integrity is in allowing ourselves the freedom
to move between our grief and the life we are rebuilding now.

As I reflect on our journey since losing Sam, I see the early times when our time was
dominated by loss and only with extreme effort and guarding of our hearts was it possible
to exit that sphere for simply a few hours.

These days, I am finding it easier to move between these spheres of loss and restoration.
It is not possible to remain in loss -- for to do so would be to deny living. Yet it is
not possible to live without the loss. We must find more of a freedom to move between our
lives-now and the grief of losing Sam and our life with him.

In our early grief it was not possible to live outside of the sphere of loss. Now I find I
can also have hours in a sphere of living now. Though there are times when the pain of
loss remains undeniable we are learning to move between the loss of our life that was, and
restoring our new life in the here and now. I am learning that it is possible to visit
loss and return to my now-life more on my own terms.

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Thankful that we are finding space for joys in the sadness.

-   We remain in the waves on a daily basis but we are also engaging in the world. We are
    cared for. We are having great days – Oh yeah.

-   Our hearts remain tender. It remains easy to get taken down by grief-pains.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family to gather around us
    to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   We are mindful of friends and families – those that remain in the fight to see their
    children through incredible health challenges (cancer or other). We hope with you and
    we will continue to celebrate your wins!

-   We are mindful of friends and families – who have seen their children die. That they
    are in similar grief storms. We grieve with you. Our hearts break again for your loss.

-   Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

Sam's life has been saved numerous times because people have donated blood or bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. Perhaps you can save someone's
life!

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of
Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the
support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all
enough.

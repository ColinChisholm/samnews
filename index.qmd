# Death of our Mighty Warrior

*Oct. 8, 2024. Our most loved mighty warrior has gone to be with Jesus.*

:::::: {layout="[35, 35, 30]"}
::: {#txt-left}
Today, in the early morning\
   Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
  racked with disease\
  and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
  our pride,\
  the joy of life that we had with him.
:::

::: {txt-mid}
\
In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
  to let go,\
  to move on.

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach.\
  without fear\
  without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
  And jumped into the eternal\
   Love of God.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us. Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did. <!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
                                                                                pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
                                                                                that do! -->

# Post: Lost

_Courage in the face of fear._

_Dec. 26, 2024_


## Courage

Courage does not mean that you are never afraid. Rather it is choosing to respond, it is
choosing to act despite fears. It is choosing to do what is right in the face of fear.

There is not a day that I am not proud of Sam. I admire his bravery. Sam was courageous.

On rare occasions Sam would express a fear. Then he would rally, gather his courage and
continue to fight on. In the week before he died, he had such a moment.

### A moment of fear

In those last days Sam seemed to live in two worlds. This mortal world we know and what
seemed to be the world beyond/ behind the "veil". Occasionally, it was like we got
glimpses behind the veil -- that is beyond death. I tell you this, as this context helped
me have words that I could say to Sam in his moment of fear.

It was 3:30pm on Oct. 1^st^. Tina and I were down the hall talking to some of Sam's
medical team when I received a phone call. It was Sam, he had managed to call me from
Nana's phone. ... He was scared.

We rushed back to the room. His words were simple but they spoke from a deep fear: "*Dad,
I was lost.*"

I wrapped my arms around him and told him that:

-   *Sam, you are not lost. You will never be lost.*
-   *God is with you. He will find you there.*
-   *You may be travelling paths that you have never travelled,*
-   *Be free to explore any new paths that you find.*

Sam immediately settled. He took courage.\
One week later he travelled beyond my reach.

## Lost

Grief is our natural response to loss. We have lost Sam and this hurts.

In addition to feeling this deep loss, I also feel lost.

*What has happened? How did I get here? What do I do now? How do we move forward? What
direction should we go?*

All my ways of being. All my familiar paths are gone. I must walk new paths. Yet, my mind
does not want to let go of the routines I loved -- the ones with Sam.

## Courage to move

My own words to Sam haunt me.

*Did I speak them to him? Or did I speak them to myself?*

As my beautiful boy did, I must take courage. I may be travelling new and unknown paths.
Now, I must recognize the freedom to explore -- even enjoy these unexpected paths before
me.\
I asked Sam to call out to God. I must do the same.

There is much love on these new paths we currently walk.\
We are surrounded by the love of friends and family who walk with us.

Though we sometimes feel lost and afraid we take courage and continue to move forward.
Together.

## Christmas Season

Absolutely, there are moments and sometimes whole days that are simply hard. These times
have tears. These times have deep grief-pain that can feel completely debilitating.

However, there has also been much beauty as we share in the love of friends and family.

-   In the days leading up to Christmas:

    -   We got out. We chose to not be lost in our grief but to bring joy. I put a kit
        together to share special coffees – the addition of some holiday syrups helped
        this. We sang Christmas carols.
    -   We had people in.
    -   We went to the Christmas Eve church service. I have to admit it was a little
        overwhelming but I am glad we did it. We spent time with the family, at my parents
        place.

-   Christmas Day was a full and beautiful day:

    -   Having slept over at Mom and Dad's, we had a nice morning with them before
        returning home to have a few hours on our own and to have our own private gift
        exchange.
    -   At home, one of Sam's best friends stopped by to wish us a Merry Christmas.
    -   In the afternoon we went up to Tom and MA's place where we watched their boys open
        gifts, shared Christmas dinner (thanks Mom!), and played games.
    -   In the later evening a good friend came over for a visit.

## Victories and Heart Aches

-   Our hearts remain tender. It remains easy to get taken down by grief-pains. As I write
    this I am trying hard to rally.

-   Our hearts ache. We are committed to moving forward but this is hard work.

-   We are thankful for the extraordinary effort of friends and family to gather around us
    to care for us.

-   We are thankful for many messages of care and solidarity with us as we grieve.

-   We are thankful for many special messages reflecting what Sam has meant to people.

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments we had with Sam.

-   We are mindful of friends and families – those that remain in the fight to see their
    children through incredible health challenges (cancer or other). We hope with you and
    we will continue to celebrate your wins!

-   We are mindful of friends and families – who have seen their children die. That they
    are in similar grief storms. We grieve with you. Our hearts break again for your loss.

-   Our hearts ache. We grieve. Yet Sam is free of disease.

### Oncology Families

A special note to all of the families that we have travelled with -- to those in their own storms.

Know that we stand with you.

-   We will celebrate each of your wins -- we hope and pray your warriors have a lifetime of wins.

-   Should you ever find yourselves on a path of grief -- we will grieve with you. I hope you never have to travel this path. Yet I know some will.
    And you will not be alone.

## Become a donor

Sam's life has been saved numerous times because people have donated blood or bone marrow. Consider becoming a donor. Perhaps you can save someone's
life!

## Financial Support

Here we include options to provide financial support including: cancer research at the BC Children's Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House, Friends of
Children (support for families from Northern BC), or to support us directly. We have been blown away by the generosity of so many. We also love the
support provided in words of encouragement. Please feel free to [send us notes of encouragement](contact.html). It is impossible to thank you all
enough.

# Ready for the BMT

*Nov. 14, 2023*


![Friends and family visits from this past week. So good to see all of you!](https://samsstory.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2023-11-14_friends-this-week.jpg)

Today is the day and Sam is ready!

Sam had a couple rough days leading up to today but he is now
comfortable, settled into the the isolation room, and ready to take on
the BMT. The actual transplant will happen later today and 
should be rather anti-climatic.  The transplant is similar to receiving blood
the difference being that the material in the bag
will be bone marrow stem cells. These cells will take up residence in
Sam's bone marrow and start generating new blood – transplanted blood providing a new immune system.

Yesterday went well. The greatest challenge was moving Sam across the
hall. It sounds simple but I was wiped out by the end of the day. In moving over everything had to be sterilized.
Most items were thoroughly wiped, and placed in clean containers.
Laundry had to be re-done as I had not washed the clothes to BMT clean
standards. The medical team also had a big task taking all of the furniture out of the
room, sterilized the room, and then they cleaned and sterilized each piece of
furniture before returning it.

Sam's isolation room is similar to the other rooms here on the ward. It
has his medical bed, a recliner chair and a fold down couch/bed for Tina
and I. The difference is that there is a small anteroom. This room has
two sets of glass sliding doors. One door leads to the ward and the
other to Sam's room. Only one door is allowed to be open at one time to
ensure that the air in Sam's room is clean. In the anteroom we clean any
items before they are passed into the room. It also in this room that we
put on gowns to cover out 'dirty' outside world clothing.  It is actually much simpler for 
Tina and I to leave and enter
than I had expected.

Yesterday's highlights was seeing friends. Sam was able to visit with Ben while Tina
and I visited with David and Krista C. – following their visit Sam moved
to the isolation room. In the evening Uncle Cal stopped was able to wave
at Sam through the window. Senga and Tina were also able visit.

## Upcoming today

Off course today is *the day.* Sam will receive his bone marrow
transplant. This will be likely be sometime in the afternoon but it
completely depends on when the donor material arrives. We have no idea
if it is coming from within the city or from across the globe. In a
couple years there may be an opportunity to meet the donor. Whoever you
are *I can not thank you enough*!.

## Victories and concerns

-   There are many known and unknown concerns that will present
    themselves during the BMT process. Potential illness,
    establishment/engraftment of the donated bone-marrow/ stem cells.
    Numerous potential complications. We are thankful for a medical team
    that has a plan for all of it.

-   We are thankful that it seems Sam's pain management is now under
    control, including options to address any spikes in pain.

-   We are thankful for friends that are able to visit.

-   It had been amazing to see Sam out from under the influence of
    chemotherapy. To see him return to strength of mind and to have
    capacity for more activity. It is hard to see him have this strength
    pulled away from him.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam. If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C., or
    contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca) office.

-   We have completed a major chapter in Sam's treatment. With the
    completion of this last/ sixth round of chemotherapy and targeted
    radiation. We now pivot to the bone marrow transplant -- this
    current and upcoming treatments brings hope of removal of the
    disease but also anxiety about both the challenging process and the
    potential for long term side effects. We hope and pray that this
    treatment will be effective in beating the cancer for life.

-   It is flu season and covid is still out there. If any of us get sick
    it will add challenges to Sam and the BMT process as he will be
    entering a phase where he has no immune system for weeks.

-   We are continually thankful for our medical teams here. They
    continue to provide incredible care. They are always open to
    conversation and answering questions. They have been incredibly
    pro-active and I am glad we are prepared for the next steps.

-   In preparation for the BMT there are numerous items that need to
    come together:

    1.  Due to some timing and logistics we have had to change donors.
        We are thankful for this current donor who will provide a
        peripheral blood sample and is a good match for Sam.
    2.  We are desiring that side effects both immediate and long-term
        would be limited. *Ideally, that there would be no measurable
        side effects long term*.
    3.  The medical team has a huge coordination task ahead of them.
        From our meetings with them it seems all of the pieces are
        coming together, but with so many moving parts it is easy for
        things go wrong.
    4.  These last days leading up to the BMT are very busy with lots of
        drugs running all day. Concerns during this time are that
        everything is able to be delivered as planned and that Sam does
        not have any overly negative reactions to any of this.

-   We are thankful for the support of family and friends. Thank you for
    your notes of encouragement.

-   There is always concern as the cancer remains. We long for the day
    when Sam is clear of this disease.

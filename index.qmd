## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly did.
<!-- -   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do! -->

# Death of our Mighty Warrior 

:::::{layout-ncol="2"}


:::{#txt-left}
*Oct. 8, 2024*

Today, in the early morning\
\ \  Tina and I sat with Sam.\

Despite his body being\
\ \ racked with disease\
\ \ and his near inability to communicate,

We had a beautiful time of sharing with him.\

We expressed our love,\
\ \ our pride, \
\ \ the joy of life that we had with him. 

In that time\
We gave him the freedom\
\ \ to let go,\
\ \ to move on. 

Tina and I saw it.\
The precise moment, 7:10am, that\
He moved beyond our reach. \
\ \ without fear\
\ \ without pain or suffering.

Courageously he let go of us.\
\ \ And jumped into the eternal \
\ \ \ Love of God.

One day I will try to tell you about it.\
There is a mystery here.

Despite this going the direction that we do not want to go.
I have found a beauty, even a sombre joy in caring for my boy.\
There is peace here in the room.

Currently, Tina and Sam are sleeping comfortably.\
I am sitting at the window as the morning sun begins to light up the city.

# Precious Moments

*Sept 25, 2024*

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## TL;DR [Too long didn't read (i.e. the short version)]{.small}

-   Back in hospital.
-   The left side pleural effusion has returned.
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Sept. 27, 2024
Sam continues to receive amazing care.

Although Sam's surgery was delayed,
he was able to go in first
thing this morning. Everything went according to plan and he
and was out again within the hour.

The surgery seems to have gone well draining almost a litre of fluid
from the pleural space of his left lung. Sam is breathing easier and 
has nice colour in his cheeks and lips.

Although a faint glimmer of hope remains we must prepare ourselves for
the worst.

I feel the need to be present for each precious moment. Every simple
sentence of *"Hi Dad*", *"I'm happy"*, or *"Just resting"* is a precious
treasure. I want to hold each moment but they too quickly slip into the
past and instantly start to fade. I grieve as each treasure slips past
me. Oh that I could stop time and live with each one.

Be ready, the next moment, the next treasure is coming. How many more do
we get? Do we have weeks? Days? I want a lifetime of them.

We are living in a time warp -- time is slow but still moves far too
fast.

## Looking back

Sunday

:   The oncology team called and asked us to come into the hospital as
    the fluid that was around Sam's lung had bacteria in it and he
    needed to start a round of antibiotics. The truth is we likely would
    have come in by the end of the day anyways – Sam was having a harder
    time breathing and was retaining fluid.

    Being the weekend we had to enter the hospital via the Emergency
    Dept. The team there got some initial tests done. A chest x-ray
    showed that the left side pleural effusion (fluid around the lung)
    was starting to build up again. Anitbiotics were started.

    In the early evening we were transferred up to the oncology ward
    where we settled in. This place is familiar and the team does a
    great job of ensuring Sam is cared for. Despite sleeping on the
    pullout-bed, I had a better sleep than I had the nights before, as
    we had professional backup in nurses that we knew and trusted.

Monday

:   The main issue being addressed during our days here is that Sam has
    reduced airflow – definitely influenced by the pleural effusion but
    this may also be caused by the cancer.

    With reduced lung capacity Sam is on supplemental oxygen. Before any
    procedures are planned for managing the fluid in his chest the team
    needs to better understand what is causing it. Options include: an
    infection, or impacts of the cancer (see below). If the effusion is
    related to an infection the use of antibiotics should start to
    resolve the issue. If it is caused by the cancer other options may
    still be available. Determining the cause takes time and so we wait.

    Sam rested most of the the morning. In the afternoon he had enough
    energy to play a video game with me. This is something he had been
    longing to do for several days but had not had the energy for. We
    had a great time together saving humanity from massive bugs that
    threatened future civilization. It was so good to see him be himself
    for a couple hours.

    The remainder of the afternoon was spent talking with doctors,
    resting, visiting with Gram and Papa C. As a family, the three of
    us, we have been watching a survival reality show: "Alone". The
    experiences of the show's participants resonate with Sam.

Tuesday

:   Sam rests for the morning each day and as we watch him it seems he
    is more tired and harder to rouse. Yet we remain in a holding
    pattern -- results are still pending from BC Cancer regarding the
    abnormal cells found in pleural-fluid. Antibiotics are still
    running.

    Mid-afternoon we had an encouraging interaction as Dr. Jacob came by
    to check in on Sam. He has a way about him that brings reassurance
    that Sam is in good hands. We all played a game of Kingdomino – it
    was great to see strategy-Sam show up. There was definitely nothing
    wrong with his thinking ... once he got thinking.

    The afternoon and evening were filled with family including Gram and
    Papa C, Nana, and Uncle Kevin and Aunt Shannon. Visits are generally
    quiet as Sam needs to rest.

Wednesday

:   It is Wednesday morning as I write this. Sam has been resting all
    morning with a simple excursion to the x-ray department. The pleural
    effusion remains and appears to be slightly worse.

    A precious moment from this morning was when both Tina and I simply
    sat with Sam who was resting. One of us on each side of his hospital
    bed. Each of us holding one of his hands. Oh how I wish I could make
    these moments last.

## Cancer impacts

### Direct

The cancer has grown and it has a choke hold on Sam... literally. It is
starting to compress major arteries. It is compressing the Superior Vena
Cava (SVC) narrowing the bloodflow into his heart. It is starting to
compress the major bronchus to his left lung. All this means that
bloodflow and airflow, while believed to be currently adequate, are both
being reduced. Further reduction will continue as the cancer grows. It
is unknown if current treatment can slow the cancer

### Indirect

It is likely that the cancer is causing the fluid to build up in Sam's
pleural space. The mechanism causing this is not well understood other
than cancer is known to cause it. The team is considering options to
control/reduce the fluid buildup.

## Victories and concerns

-   We are thankful for the simple precious moments.

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 19^th^ and 3^rd^ CT scans).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer.

    -   Sam has begun a schedule of oral chemotherapy.
    -   Nivolumab has been shown to be ineffective and use has been
        stopped. ~~He has continued with his immunotherapy -- had
        another dose of Nivolumab (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The
        therapy will be effective, and 2) That there will be no further
        complications that could restrict the use of the drug.~~

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.
    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Surgeries:

    -   A surgery to drain/manage fluid in Sam's left lung (again) is
        being planned for tomorrow (Sept. 26).
    -   Surgery to drain the left-side Pleural Effusion (fluid on lung)
        went well (Sept. 19).
    -   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid
        around his heart – a [pericardial
        effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0).
        We are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid
        went well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was
        challenging but Sam has made it through again!
    -   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15,
        see [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The
        outcome was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a
        return to near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major
        vein).

-   Highs, especially for Sam:

    -   [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11 trip (Sept 8-11): Our
        soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
        friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his
        friends from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars
        have lifted/blessed all three of us.
    -   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
        Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) .
        He served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many
        thanks to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to
        think of a happy place he returns here in his mind and he is
        quick to share stories of these days. \`\`\`

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.

## What we need

In this intense time we need:

-   You to come close to us. We need to know you are with us.
    Practically speaking send us your notes of love and encouragement.\
    Don't think that we are getting too many messages. We might not have
    capacity to respond but we will read them all.
-   In the face of fear choose courage. We are. Sam certainly is.
-   Encourage Sam's friends to reach out to him. Send him notes and
    pictures. They can likely find him on SnapChat. Many thanks to those
    that do!

## A full week

It has been a good week. Sam's classmates from Cedars Christian School
were here and Sam was able to join them a number of times. Time with his
friends was such an encouragement to Sam -- and to Tina and me.

### Times with classmates!

This past Sunday evening the [Cedars](https://cedars.bc.ca) Grade 11's
rolled into Abbotsford. We were able to join them there -- sharing a
meal at the Old Spaghetti Factory. After dinner Sam hopped on the bus
and experienced a glimpse of the fun had in transit. In Vancouver, near
Commercial and Hastings, the crew moved into a local church that would
be their home away from home. Sam had a great visit that evening before
the three of us returned to RMH.

I am so thankful to Cedars and the hosting YWAM team as they always
welcomed Sam and were able to allow Sam to join in as he had energy.

I am incredibly impressed with [YWAM's Mission
Adventures](https://www.ywamvancouver.org/mission-adventures) program --
it is really well designed, and their staff did an excellent job of
leading the students through all the activities. I am also incredibly
impressed with the Cedars team (staff, parent chaperones, and all the
students!). They all served, and engaged one another and all the ideas
presented to them really well – through some very full days and intense
topics.

Monday

:   Students were split into small groups (3-4) to experience two sides
    of Vancouver. The east is in the throes of poverty, addiction, and
    common mental health issues. In stark contrast, mere blocks to the
    west, the business district is characterized by affluent wealth
    seemingly ignorant to the challenges in the east.

    *Sam was able to join this day for a couple of hours. He spent over
    an hour walking – more than he has done in long-long time. He loved
    sharing this time with classmates, interactions with the people,
    though this large energy output had consequences. Days later Sam is
    still trying to restore his energy reserves.*

Tuesday

:   Students served at a number of different ministries assisting the
    east-side community during the day. In the evening YWAM led the
    students through a seminar presenting the issues of pornography, sex
    trafficking, and highlighting the links to violence against women –
    intense yet important topics. The reflective work for these topics
    were set into the context of a prayer vigil.

    *Sam was able to rally energy to join the students for their evening
    meal (Jamaican) followed by the evening session back at the church.
    It was a privilege to see the students continue to work through the
    material after the session. They got it. They wrestled with it. They
    cared.*

Wednesday

:   Students experienced other cultures through their religions touring
    a Mosque, Buddist, and Sikh temples.

    *Sam had clinic that morning and was still recovering from Monday's
    walk, so he was not able to attend the temple tours. Later in the
    day, following a solid nap, Sam had enough energy to connect with
    his class once again. First, there was dinner out (Indian), then it
    was back to the church for a debrief session.*

    It was during this debrief session that Sam's classmates pressed in
    around him, and took time to pray for him. ... It was simply
    beautiful to experience the love his friends poured out to him.

    To end the evening the whole group walked to get ice cream --
    gelato. Thirty kids-in-a-candy-store (including adults) as we tried
    to decide what 2 of 238 flavours to choose from!

Thursday

:   We did not get to see them off but the students packed up and
    started their trip home to Prince George.

    *Sam woke up that morning expressing how he has such a great life.
    His heart had been filled. He experienced and knows that he is
    loved.*

### Additional connections

Love extended to our family was not limited to the Cedars group. Since
our last post Dave and Rhoda, Nana, the Frickers, and Uncle Cal have all
been able stop in.

Sam has also had on his heart to extend care to another young man who is
currently at BCCH[^1] and is expected to undergo a BMT in the weeks
ahead. Sam has initiated stopping by to encourage him a number of times
in the last couple of weeks.

## Medical status

There has been so much beauty in the interactions that we have had this
past week.\
These interactions have been full of loving-friendship/care and have not
failed to acknowledge that Sam's journey is so challenging.

The previous week Sam was able to have another dose of Nivolumab (Sept
4) – continuing with his immunotherapy. Given the intensity of the
events in August the medical team is keeping a close-eye on Sam. By the
end of today Sam will have had four clinic visits and two
echocardiograms since the last post. To date the clinic visits have been
good/simple and without any drama.

::: center
***Is the immunotherapy working?***
:::

This is a common question that we receive and it is a very important
question.

However, it is not one that I can answer -- at least not yet. It is not
possible to monitor the development of Sam's cancer on a daily or even
weekly basis. We have to wait 3-4 weeks before we can evaluate if the
treatment is working.

To-date, since reaching theoretically therapeutic levels of Nivolumab,
Sam has not been able to have uninterrupted treatment without other
complications causing delays. One of our current hopes is that we will
be able to continue with immunotherapy treatment without interruption,
so we can have a proper evaluation if the immunotherapy is working.

So we continue to wait and we continue to do the hard work of hope.

## Victories and concerns

-   Our soul-hearts have been refreshed! Filled with the love of
    friendship. It was incredible to see Sam have time with his friends
    from school. The students and the leaders from Cedars have
    lifted/blessed all three of us.

-   The cancer has grown (as of Sept. 3 CT scan).

-   To date, the medicines and interventions that have been tried have
    not had any significant or lasting effect at controlling this
    disease. We need a miracle.

-   Sam is fighting on despite continued growth of the cancer. He has
    continued with his immunotherapy -- had another dose of Nivolumab
    (Sept. 4). It is our hope that 1) The therapy will be effective,
    and 2) That there will be no further complications that could
    restrict the use of the drug.

-   Waves:

    -   Despite times of encouragement the waves of fear still hit us
        (Tina and I). It remains hard to watch when Sam is in pain or
        lacks capacity – this is where hope takes work.

    -   Our energy levels, or lack of energy, come in waves. Sometimes
        the waves are strong enough to knock you over. We need strength
        for this journey.

-   Sam's heart is healthy and strong despite having had fluid around
    his heart – a [pericardial
    effusion](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pericardial-effusion-0). We
    are thankful that the surgery to drain all of the extra fluid went
    well (Aug. 23). Recovery from this procedure was challenging but Sam
    has made it through again!

-   We are celebrating the success of Sam's stent surgery (Aug. 15, see
    [here](/posts/2408/2024-08-16_surgery-celebration.qmd)). The outcome
    was far better than we had hoped for resulting in a return to
    near-normal blood-flow! (for that particular major vein).

-   It was amazing to see Sam join the [Ness Lake Bible
    Camp](https://www.nesslakebiblecamp.com) team (July 28 - 31) . He
    served, ran, talked, played -- he got to be fully there! Many thanks
    to the NLBC team who welcomed him in. When Sam needs to think of a
    happy place he returns here in his mind and he is quick to share
    stories of these days.

-   We are thankful to the medical team here at [BC Childrens'
    Hospital](http://www.bcchildrens.ca) who have explained things
    incredibly well and who have worked professionally and confidently.
    Your clear communication, compassion, and medical care give us great
    confidence. Sam has never lacked for incredible care.

-   We are thankful for the gift of a place to stay so close to the
    hospital. The [Ronald McDonald House (RMH)](https://rmhbc.ca) has
    provided us a home away from home. This place is an amazing example
    of charity at work.

-   Thankful for friends who have chosen to meet regularly to pray for
    Sam (we are also thankful for everyone praying for Sam wherever you
    are). If you would like to join them talk with Beth H., Krista C.,
    or contact the [Westwood Church](https://westwoodchurch.bc.ca)
    office.

-   Thankful for such supportive family and friends caring for us all
    through this journey.

-   We long for the day when Sam is free of this disease.
